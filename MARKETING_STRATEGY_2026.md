# TINY SEED FARM: 10-POINT DIRECT MARKETING STRATEGY
## Pittsburgh Market Deep Dive & Accountability Calendar

**Created:** January 15, 2026
**Target Launch:** March 2026 (aligned with growing season)
**Philosophy:** 80% Automated / 20% "One-Thumb" Real-Time (Root System v2.0)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Opportunity
Pittsburgh's local food market is **underserved but educated**. The city has a strong farm-to-table culture built by Penn's Corner Farm Alliance over 20+ years, yet individual farms struggle with marketing bandwidth. Your competitors are strong on product but weak on digital engagement and automation.

### Your Edge
- **Technology**: Tiny Seed OS gives you infrastructure competitors don't have
- **Speed**: "Field Mode" content creation in 45 seconds vs their hours
- **Data**: Real-time inventory tied to marketing = no overselling, smart promotions
- **Automation**: Triggers that run while you're in the field

---

## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS

### Primary Competitors

| Farm | Strengths | Weaknesses | Your Opportunity |
|------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| **Dillner Family Farm** | 80+ years legacy, 110+ varieties, multiple pickup locations (Mt Lebanon, Squirrel Hill, Wexford) | Traditional marketing, limited digital presence, $545/season large share pricing | Undercut on flexibility (your Flex CSA), beat on digital engagement |
| **Harvest Valley Farms** | 4th generation, 100+ varieties, 22-week season, sustainable practices, cheese add-ons | Limited pickup locations (on-farm only), no apparent delivery | Offer delivery convenience, restaurant wholesale they're not pursuing |
| **Who Cooks For You Farm** | Certified organic, strong farmers market presence (Squirrel Hill & Bloomfield), flexible Market CSA option | First generation (2009), smaller scale | Match their organic certification, beat on technology and convenience |

### Secondary Competitors
- **Blackberry Meadows Farm** - Certified organic since 1992, strong legacy
- **Cherry Valley Organics** - Customizable boxes, multiple pickup locations
- **Edible Earth Farm** - Year-round delivery, 68 miles from Pittsburgh
- **Penn's Corner Farm Alliance** - 30+ farm cooperative, restaurant wholesale dominant

### Competitive Gap Analysis
**What NO competitor is doing well:**
1. Real-time "farm updates" via app/SMS (Root System advantage)
2. Dynamic pricing for surplus (your Dutch Auction concept)
3. Automated new-neighbor outreach (Welcome Wagon)
4. Restaurant cluster delivery optimization
5. Gamified customer engagement (Partner Passport)
