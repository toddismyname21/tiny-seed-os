## EMAIL VERSION

**To:** Beau [email]
**Cc:** Loren
**Subject:** FINAL NOTICE: Payment Agreement Required - $5,745.50 Outstanding

---

Beau,

I received your $300 payment. That leaves **$5,745.50 still outstanding**.

You did not respond to my December 9th email. You did not respond to my December 12th email. You made a single payment without any communication. This is not acceptable.

I have attached a formal Payment Agreement. The terms are:

- **$1,000 due immediately** (by January 23, 2026)
- **$1,000 per week** until paid in full
- **Paid off in 6 weeks** (by February 27, 2026)

**If I do not receive:**
1. The signed agreement, AND
2. The first $1,000 payment

**By January 23, 2026**, I will file a claim in Beaver County Small Claims Court for the full balance plus court costs. No further notice will be given.

I have tried to work with you. I have been patient for over a year. I have asked politely twice. You have ignored me.

This is your last opportunity to resolve this outside of court.

Sign the agreement. Make the payment. Communicate with me.

## CERTIFIED MAIL VERSION

[Print on Letterhead]

**January 16, 2026**

**VIA CERTIFIED MAIL - RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED**

[City, State ZIP]

**RE: FINAL DEMAND FOR PAYMENT - $5,745.50**

Dear Mr. [Last Name],

This letter constitutes a formal and final demand for payment of $5,745.50 owed to Tiny Seed Farm LLC for products delivered between September 2024 and October 2025.

Despite previous requests dated December 9, 2025 and December 12, 2025, you have failed to respond or propose any payment arrangement. Your recent payment of $300.00 is acknowledged but leaves a substantial balance outstanding.

**DEMAND:** I demand payment in full of $5,745.50, or execution of the enclosed Payment Agreement with first payment of $1,000.00, no later than **January 23, 2026**.

The enclosed Payment Agreement provides for:
- Initial payment of $1,000.00 upon signing
- Weekly payments of $1,000.00
- Full satisfaction of debt by February 27, 2026

**NOTICE:** If I do not receive either (1) payment in full, or (2) the signed Payment Agreement with first payment by January 23, 2026, I will immediately file a civil complaint in the Beaver County Magisterial District Court seeking judgment for the full amount owed plus court costs and any other relief permitted by law.

I am prepared to pursue all legal remedies available to me, including but not limited to judgment liens, wage garnishment, and reporting to credit bureaus.

This matter can still be resolved without court involvement. I urge you to contact me immediately to discuss payment.

Sincerely,
