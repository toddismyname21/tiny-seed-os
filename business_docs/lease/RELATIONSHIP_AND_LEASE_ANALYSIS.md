# Todd-Don Relationship & Lease Analysis
## Tiny Seed Farm at Kretschmann Farm
### Comprehensive Analysis - January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding:** Don has made public commitments to a long-term arrangement but has not formalized them in writing. Todd has been requesting formalization since December 2022. A draft lease was created in 2023 but never signed.

**Bottom Line:** The relationship is strong and supportive, but the lack of written agreement creates significant vulnerability for Todd's substantial investments.

## Part 2: Don's Public Commitments

### Commitment #1: December 2024 (to CSA Customers)

**Email:** "Getting the farm band back together again"

> "In a nutshell, **the farm will remain in a land trust and Todd will have a long-term lease** where he can continue to grow organic produce **indefinitely**."

**Analysis:** This is a PUBLIC statement to hundreds of former CSA members. Don has represented to his community that Todd has long-term security.

### Commitment #2: September 2024 (to CSA Customers)

**Email:** "A plea for the future of our farm"

> "We're on the path to **donating the land itself to a community farmland trust to be leased on a permanent basis** to the next generation of farmers. The good news is that currently we have a former employee, leasing about 5 A and growing a wide variety of organic vegetables..."

**Analysis:** Don has publicly stated his intention to put the land into a trust with permanent agricultural use.

### Commitment #3: Agrarian Commons PDF

**Context:** Don sent Todd information about Agrarian Trust's model for community land trusts.

**Analysis:** This suggests Don is actively considering the Agrarian Commons pathway for the farm's future.

## Part 3: The Unsigned 2023 Draft Lease

### What It Contains

The "KretschmannFarmBetaLease2023.docx" is a comprehensive lease document covering:

| Element | Draft Terms |
|---------|-------------|
| **Land Rate** | $500/acre/year |
| **Term** | "x to y" (NOT FILLED IN) |
| **Termination** | 2 months notice by either party |
| **Security Deposit** | $500 |
| **Permitted Uses** | Organic crop production |
| **Prohibited Uses** | Non-organic, animal husbandry |
| **Capital Improvements** | Lessor pays, lessee maintains |
| **Insurance** | Required |
| **Soil Health** | Maintenance required |
| **Cover Crops** | Required by Nov 1 |

### What's Missing

1. **Term dates never filled in** - "x to y" left blank
2. **Signatures never added**
3. **No explanation why it was never signed**

### Critical Weakness in Draft

**2-month termination notice** is very short for a farmer who:
- Plants perennial cover crops
- Makes soil investments
- Plans seasons months/years ahead
- Has made significant infrastructure investments

## Part 4: Objective Relationship Assessment

### Strengths of the Relationship

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Trust** | 10+ years of collaboration; equipment access; no disputes |
| **Support** | Don actively promotes Todd's business to former customers |
| **Fairness** | Transparent pricing formula; reasonable rates |
| **Shared Vision** | Both committed to organic agriculture |
| **Mentorship** | Don shares knowledge freely |

### Concerns in the Relationship

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Formalization Avoidance** | Todd asked in Dec 2022; still no signed lease in 2026 |
| **Vague Timelines** | "Land trust" mentioned but no concrete steps/dates |
| **Power Imbalance** | Todd invested; Don holds all property rights |
| **Competing Interests** | Maria (daughter) has separate operation on property |
| **Age/Succession** | Don's health/estate planning unclear |

### Interpretation

Don appears to have **genuine good intentions** toward Todd and the farm's future. However:

1. **Vagueness may be avoidance** - Formalizing means confronting difficult questions (estate planning, family succession, legal complexity)

2. **Todd bears disproportionate risk** - Don's intentions don't protect Todd legally

3. **Land trust is not yet real** - It's an aspiration, not an executed plan

4. **No timeline pressure on Don** - Without pushback, formalization may continue to drift

## Part 5: Current Financial Arrangement Audit

### Annual Costs (~$15,525 baseline)

| Category | Amount | Assessment |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Land (6 acres @ $500/acre) | $3,000 | **FAIR** - Below PA market rate |
| Infrastructure | ~$4,558 | **FAIR** - Depreciation + 5% maintenance |
| Machinery | ~$7,254 | **EXCELLENT VALUE** - $100K+ equipment access |
| Fuel | ~$614 | **FAIR** - Allocated by actual usage |
| Other | ~$99 | **FAIR** |

### Value Assessment

**What Todd Gets:**
- 6 acres of certified organic land
- Greenhouse (27x96)
- High Tunnel (21x96)
- Multiple tractors (Allis G, Kubota, MF285, MF296, Ford 1710)
- Coolers, planters, implements
- Barn and wagon shed space
- Custom tractor work available

**Market Comparison:**
- Similar setup without equipment: $12,000-18,000/year
- Similar setup WITH equipment ownership: $100,000+ capital investment

**Verdict:** The financial arrangement is **exceptionally favorable** to Todd. The cost structure is fair and transparent.

**The issue is not price - it's security.**

---

## Part 7: Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (For Todd)

1. **Reference Don's public commitments** in any formalization discussion:
   - "You told our CSA community I'd have a long-term lease indefinitely"
   - "You mentioned the land trust path - where are we on that?"

2. **Request signing the 2023 draft lease with modifications:**
   - Extend termination notice to 12 months (not 2)
   - Add right of first refusal
   - Add improvement reimbursement terms
   - Define term (suggest 5 years minimum)

3. **Document your investments** immediately:
   - Photo inventory of everything you own on the property
   - List of soil improvements made
   - Customer/revenue records showing business built at this location

### Conversation Approach

Don is relationship-oriented. Approach should be:
- Appreciative of the arrangement
- Frame formalization as protecting BOTH parties
- Connect to his stated values (land stewardship, farm legacy)
- Offer to do the paperwork yourself

**Sample framing:**
> "Don, I want to honor your vision of keeping this land agricultural forever. The best way I can do that is by being in a position to invest long-term. A written lease protects your legacy and lets me commit fully to building soil and infrastructure here."
