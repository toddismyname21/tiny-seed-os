# Todd Wilson - Goals for Tiny Seed Farm
## Captured: January 2026

---

## Short-Term Goals (2026 Season)

### Operations
- **Acreage:** Expand from 6 to **10 acres**
- **Revenue target:** $500,000
- **CSA goals:** 250 vegetable members + 50 flower members = **300 total**

### Market Strategy
- Focus on **storage crops** (new)
- **Corner the baby greens market** in Pittsburgh
- Continue restaurant/wholesale relationships

### Financial Reality
- **No immediate investment plans** - budget is tight
- 2025 was a **transitional year with significant losses**
- Need to recover financially before major investments

### Context
- Expanding acreage by 67% (6 → 10 acres)
- Ambitious revenue goal requires execution, not capital expenditure
- Strategy is market positioning (baby greens) over infrastructure

---

## Medium-Term Goals (2027-2029)

### Scale
- **Acreage:** 12-15 acres (max vision: 20 acres)
- **Philosophy:** Incremental growth - master systems before expanding
- Prioritize **systems and consistency** over rapid scaling

### Infrastructure Investment (YOUR equipment to install)
- Build another **propagation house**
- Install **30' x 100' high tunnel** (Todd owns)
- Install **four 15' x 90' caterpillar tunnels** (Todd owns)

### Definition of "Established"
- Fully understand all systems on the property
- Good **customer retention**
- **Consistent sales** across channels

### Critical Note
Todd plans to install **his own infrastructure** (tunnels worth $15,000-30,000+) on land he has **no signed lease for**. This is a significant risk without security of tenure.

---

## Long-Term Vision (5-10 Years)

### Commitment to Kretschmann Property
- **Wants to be there long-term** - this is not a stepping stone
- Fine with leasing structure **if it provides security**
- Does NOT want to invest more if he'll have to start over elsewhere
- Would commit fully with the right agreement

### Rent-to-Own Vision
- Wants to transition from renting to **rent-to-own Don's farming assets**
- This should be at the **forefront** of conversations with Don
- **Reality check:** Currently behind on payments
- Needs a strong 2026 season before having leverage for this conversation

### Values & Legacy
- Wants to **continue the tradition Don brought to his community**
- Desires to be **rooted in place**
- Committed to **agricultural tradition with reverence for the land**
- Believes in **stewardship** and a **bright future**

### What Todd Needs to Succeed
- Better understanding of the land
- Consistent production
- *"The rest will come naturally"*

### Alignment with Don's Vision
Todd's values **directly align** with Don's stated goals:
- Don wants land to stay agricultural → Todd wants to farm it long-term
- Don wants a land trust with a steward → Todd wants to be that steward
- Don speaks of legacy → Todd wants to continue that legacy

**This alignment is Todd's greatest leverage in negotiations.**

## Relationship & Security Needs

### The Tunnel Situation
- Don **does not currently want** Todd's tunnels put up
- Todd **needs to put them up** because:
  - They were a huge personal investment
  - Laying in a pile on the ground is damaging them
  - They increase crop quality and extend the season
- This creates tension between Todd's business needs and Don's preferences

### What Todd Feels Threatened By
1. **Don's vague arrangement** - no clarity, no signed lease
2. **Verbal implications from Don** that Todd is not living up to his standards
3. **Possibility this could be short-lived** - could lose everything

### Emotional Reality
Todd is operating under significant stress:
- Making major investments with no security
- Receiving criticism without clear written expectations
- Fearing he could be forced to start over elsewhere
- Has equipment deteriorating because he can't install it

### What Todd Needs to Feel Secure
- Long-term lease commitment
- Clear, written expectations (not verbal/vague)
- Permission to install his infrastructure
- Path to rent-to-own equipment
- Acknowledgment of his investment and commitment

---

## Priorities & Non-Negotiables

### What MUST Be in Any Agreement

**Investment Protection Clause:**
- If Don terminates the lease early, Todd must be reimbursed for improvements made to Don's property
- **Example: Greenhouse plastic** - Todd just replaced all greenhouse plastic at his cost with his labor on Don's greenhouses
- Other capital improvements that benefit the property should be prorated and refunded
- This is non-negotiable: *"If next year he says this isn't working out, he would have all of these things I purchased"*

### Deal Breakers

**What would cause Todd to leave?**
- **Only failure** - business failure is the only thing that would push him out
- Todd is fully committed to the property
- He's not looking for an exit - he wants to stay

### Negotiating Position Summary

| Factor | Todd's Position |
|--------|-----------------|
| Commitment level | **All-in** - wants to stay long-term |
| Main vulnerability | Investments in Don's property with no protection |
| Key ask | Investment reimbursement if terminated early |
| Deal-breaker | None (only failure would force exit) |
| Leverage | Don wants a committed steward - Todd IS that steward |

---

## Summary: What Todd Needs

1. **Signed lease** with defined term (not verbal/vague)
2. **Investment protection** - reimbursement for improvements if terminated early
3. **Permission to install tunnels** - his equipment is deteriorating
4. **Path to rent-to-own** Don's farming assets (after strong 2026 season)
5. **Clear expectations** in writing instead of verbal criticism
