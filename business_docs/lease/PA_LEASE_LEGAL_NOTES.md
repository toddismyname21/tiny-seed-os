## CRITICAL PA LEGAL REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Written Requirement (PA Statute of Frauds)

**Pennsylvania law requires leases over 3 years to be in writing and signed.**

> "Leases of more than 3 years' duration [must] be in writing and signed to be valid."
> — Penn State Extension

**Implication for Todd:**
- Any long-term lease (Proposals A, B, or C) MUST be written and signed
- Don's verbal commitments are legally unenforceable
- The 2023 draft lease was never signed = no legal protection

**Action:** Get a signed lease. Verbal agreements for 10-year or 99-year terms are worthless under PA law.

---

### 2. Default Termination Notice (PA Law)

**PA default termination requirements are VERY SHORT:**

| Lease Duration | Required Notice |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Under 1 year | 15 days |
| Over 1 year | 30 days |

**Implication for Todd:**
- Without a written lease specifying otherwise, Don could terminate with only 30 days notice
- Our proposals (12-24 months notice) are MUCH more protective than PA defaults
- This is exactly why a written lease matters

**Action:** Any lease must explicitly state termination notice requirements. The 12-24 months in our proposals are legally valid as long as both parties sign.

---

### 3. Four Essential Elements of Valid Lease

A valid PA agricultural lease must include:

| Element | Requirement | Our Proposals |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Contract | Offer, acceptance, consideration | Yes |
| Rent Terms | Amount and payment schedule | Yes - detailed |
| Transfer of Use | Landlord grants tenant right to use property | Yes |
| Intent to Return | Property returns to landlord at termination | Yes |

**All three proposals satisfy these requirements.**

---

### 4. Tenant Obligations (PA Common Law)

Pennsylvania common law implies that tenants must:

> "Maintain 'good husbandry practices' that 'conserve the fertility, usefulness, and value of the soil'"

**Implication for Todd:**
- Even without a written lease, Todd has a duty to maintain soil health
- This aligns with Todd's values and organic practices
- Can be used as leverage: "I've been exceeding this standard for 10 years"

---

### 5. Landlord Repair Obligations (PA Law)

**Important:** Under PA law, landlords have **NO legal duty to make repairs unless specified in the lease.**

> "Traditionally [the landlord] has 'no legal duty to make repairs' unless specified in lease"
> — Penn State Extension

**Implication for Todd:**
- Don's 2023 draft lease said capital repairs are his responsibility
- Without that clause, Todd would have no legal claim to reimbursement
- The capital expenses Todd paid ($2,175+) are recoverable ONLY if the lease specifies landlord responsibility

**Action:** Any signed lease MUST include the capital vs. maintenance distinction. Our proposals include this.

---

### 6. Growing Crops / Harvest Rights

PA law recognizes the doctrine of **emblements** - the right of a tenant to harvest crops planted before lease termination.

**Best Practice:** Explicitly address in lease:
- Tenant's right to harvest crops if lease ends mid-season
- Compensation for unharvested crops if landlord terminates
- Timeline for crop removal after termination

**Our proposals address this in the termination and investment protection sections.**

---

### 7. Fixture Removal Rights

**Must be specified in lease.** PA law does not have strong default protections for tenant-installed improvements.

**Implication for Todd:**
- Todd's tunnels ($15,000-30,000+) could become Don's property if not addressed
- Any improvements Todd makes could be lost without written protection
- Greenhouse plastic, irrigation, etc. - all at risk

**Our proposals explicitly address:**
- Todd-owned equipment removal rights
- Compensation for permanent improvements if terminated
- Documentation requirements for investments

| Protection | PA Default | Proposal A | Proposal B | Proposal C |

| Written Requirement | Only >3 years | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Right of First Refusal | None | 180 days | 90 days | Built into trust |
| Investment Protection | None | Full | Moderate | Permanent |
| Repair Responsibility | None specified | Defined | Defined | Defined |

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TODD

### Before Meeting with Don

1. **Print relevant PA law citations** - Don may not know the defaults favor him
2. **Reference his 2023 draft** - He already agreed to capital expense terms
3. **Emphasize writing requirement** - Verbal promises mean nothing legally

### During Negotiation

1. **Lead with relationships, not law** - Don't threaten
2. **Use law as backup** - "I've learned that PA requires..."
3. **Document everything** - Follow up verbal agreements in writing

### Non-Negotiables (From PA Law Perspective)

1. **Written and signed** - Verbal is worthless for long-term
2. **Termination notice** - Minimum 12 months (PA default is only 30 days)
3. **Investment protection** - PA law doesn't protect you otherwise
4. **Fixture ownership** - Your tunnels must be explicitly yours

## WHAT A PA AGRICULTURAL ATTORNEY WOULD SAY

Based on PA law and our situation, an attorney would likely advise:

1. **Get it in writing immediately** - 10 years without a signed lease is extremely risky

2. **Don's public statements help** - His CSA letter creates expectations, though not legally binding

3. **The 2023 draft is leverage** - Don wrote terms that favor Todd; hold him to them

4. **Record a memorandum** - Once signed, record with Beaver County to protect against sale

5. **Consider legal review** - $500-1,000 for attorney review is cheap insurance on this deal
