## TALKING POINTS FOR TODD

### Opening the Conversation

> "Don, you've been more than a landlord - you've been a mentor. I want to honor that relationship while also making it official. I've drafted something that reflects our partnership and gives us both security. It also includes something we've talked about - a path for me to eventually own some of the equipment."

### On the Partnership Framework

> "I've framed this as a partnership lease, not just a rental agreement. It acknowledges what you've contributed - your knowledge, your guidance, your land. And it gives me the security I need to keep investing in this place."

### On Rent-to-Own

> "I know I'm behind on payments right now, and I need a strong 2026 to change that. But looking ahead, I'd rather be building equity in this equipment than just renting it forever. This agreement gives us a framework - once I'm back on track, we can convert my equipment payments to purchase payments. You get the same money, I get ownership over time."

### On the Land Trust

> "I know you've been thinking about putting this land into a trust. I support that vision 100%. This agreement includes planning for that transition. I want to be the first lessee under whatever structure you create - and I want to help design it."

### On the 5-Year Term

> "Five years gives us both time to see how this works, with automatic renewal if we're both happy. It's less intimidating than a 10-year commitment, but still gives me enough security to install my tunnels and make real improvements."

### On Capital Expense Credit

> "I've documented about $2,175 in capital improvements I made that were really your responsibility under the lease you drafted in 2023 - the cooler repairs, the heater, the tree removal. Instead of asking for cash, can we apply that as a credit toward future rent?"
