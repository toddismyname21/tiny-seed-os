# PROPOSAL A: Conservative/Protective Lease
## Maximum Security for Todd

**Philosophy:** This is what a lawyer would recommend. It prioritizes protecting Todd's investments, providing long-term security, and ensuring legal enforceability. It assumes the relationship could become adversarial.

---

## RATIONALE

### Why This Approach?

Todd has operated for 10+ years without a signed lease. He has:
- Invested tens of thousands of dollars in soil amendments
- Built customer relationships worth hundreds of thousands in lifetime value
- Installed improvements on Don's property (greenhouse plastic, repairs)
- Stored his own equipment (tunnels worth $15,000-30,000+) waiting for permission

**Without legal protection, Todd could lose everything with 60 days notice.**

This proposal treats the arrangement as a business transaction requiring formal protections, not a handshake deal between friends.

## TALKING POINTS FOR TODD

### Opening the Conversation

> "Don, I've been farming here for over 10 years and I want to be here for another 30. But I'm at a point where I need to make big investments - my tunnels, more infrastructure, maybe buying some of your equipment eventually. I can't make those investments without knowing I have security. Can we finally formalize our arrangement?"

### If Don Pushes Back on Length

> "I know 10 years sounds like a long time, but for a farmer it's not. I need at least two full crop rotations to see returns on soil investments. And perennials like asparagus or berries take 3-4 years before they even produce. Without a long-term commitment, I can't grow the farm the way we both want."

### If Don Pushes Back on Right of First Refusal

> "I know you've said you want to put this into a land trust. This right of first refusal protects both of us - it gives me the chance to stay if your plans change, and it shows any future buyer that there's a committed farmer here. That actually makes the land more valuable for a land trust, not less."

### If Don Says "You Don't Trust Me"

> "It's not about trust, Don. It's about what happens if something happens to you. Your family might not share your vision. A signed lease protects your legacy - it guarantees this land stays in the hands of someone who cares about organic farming, not a developer."

### On Investment Reimbursement

> "I just replaced all the greenhouse plastic - that was $X and 40 hours of labor. I've been paying for repairs that are really capital improvements to your property. The lease you drafted in 2023 said capital expenses are the landlord's responsibility. I'm just asking us to follow your own terms."
