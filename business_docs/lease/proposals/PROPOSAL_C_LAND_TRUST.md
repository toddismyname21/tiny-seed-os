# PROPOSAL C: Creative/Land Trust Lease
## Pioneering a Community Agricultural Model

**Philosophy:** This proposal envisions the Kretschmann Farm as a pilot for the land trust model Don has discussed. It creates an interim agreement that bridges toward permanent community ownership while protecting Todd now.

---

## RATIONALE

### Don's Stated Vision

From Don's December 2024 letter to CSA members:
> "In a nutshell, the farm will remain in a land trust and Todd will have a long-term lease where he can continue to grow organic produce indefinitely."

This proposal takes Don at his word and creates a framework to make that vision real.

### The Agrarian Commons Model

Based on research into [Agrarian Trust](https://www.agrariantrust.org) and the Agrarian Commons model:
- Community-based land ownership
- 99-year equitable leases for farmers
- Affordable, non-extractive rent
- Land permanently protected from development
- Local governance including farmers

### Why This Could Work

| Factor | Alignment |
|--------|-----------|
| Don's age | Succession planning is timely |
| Don's values | Land trust matches his philosophy |
| Tax benefits | Conservation easement = major deduction |
| Todd's commitment | He wants to be the long-term steward |
| Community support | CSA members already invested |

---

## THE VISION

### Phase 1: Interim Lease (2026-2028)
Formalize the current arrangement with security provisions while planning the land trust.

### Phase 2: Land Trust Formation (2027-2029)
Create the Kretschmann Farm Land Trust (or join existing structure like Agrarian Trust).

### Phase 3: Equitable Lease (2029+)
Todd becomes the founding lessee under a 99-year equitable lease.

## TALKING POINTS FOR TODD

### Opening the Conversation

> "Don, you told your CSA members that this farm would go into a land trust and I'd have a long-term lease. I want to help make that happen. I've been researching how other farms have done this, and I have some ideas for how we could structure it."

### On the Vision

> "The Agrarian Trust model gives farmers 99-year leases - basically permanent. The land is protected from development forever. And there are real tax benefits for you. It's everything you've talked about wanting."

### On the Timeline

> "I know this is a big project. I'm proposing a 3-year interim lease while we work on the land trust formation. During that time, I'd have the security I need to install my tunnels and keep building the business. And we'd be working together on the bigger vision."

### On Tax Benefits

> "Have you talked to a tax advisor about the conservation easement deduction? If you qualify as a farmer, you can deduct up to 100% of your income for 15 years. On a property like this, that could be hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax savings."

### On the Legacy

> "This is how your legacy lives forever, Don. Not just in my hands, but in a structure that protects this land for every farmer who comes after me. That's what the land trust does - it takes your 40 years of work and makes it permanent."

### On Todd's Role

> "I want to be the founding farmer in this trust. I want to help design the governance, serve on the board, and be here for the next 30 years building on what you started. This isn't about me getting something - it's about protecting something we both love."
