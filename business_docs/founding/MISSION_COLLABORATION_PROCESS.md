# Mission Statement Collaboration Process
## Tiny Seed Farm

---

## Purpose

Create a mission statement that authentically reflects the goals, values, and vision of the entire farm team - not just ownership. A collaboratively-developed mission creates stronger buy-in and guides better decisions.

## Process Overview

Each team member completes the reflection worksheet independently.

### Phase 2: Small Group Synthesis (1 session, 60-90 min)
Team gathers to share reflections and identify common themes.

### Phase 3: Draft Creation (Owner/Facilitator)
Owner synthesizes themes into 2-3 draft mission statements.

### Phase 4: Team Feedback (1 week)
Team reviews drafts and provides written feedback.

### Phase 5: Final Refinement (1 session, 30-45 min)
Team finalizes language together.
