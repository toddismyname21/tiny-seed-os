## SAMPLE VALUES (For Inspiration)

### From Other Farms & Food Businesses

| Value | What It Could Mean |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Integrity** | We do what we say. No shortcuts, no excuses. |
| **Quality** | We only sell what we'd proudly feed our families. |
| **Stewardship** | We leave the land better than we found it. |
| **Community** | We're neighbors first, business second. |
| **Transparency** | We show how it's grown and what it costs. |
| **Respect** | For the land, the work, each other, our customers. |
| **Learning** | We get better every season. |
| **Joy** | Good food should bring happiness. |
| **Sustainability** | Built to last, not just built to grow. |
| **Fairness** | Fair pay, fair prices, fair treatment. |

### Don's Legacy Values (From Correspondence)

Based on Don Kretschmann's 40 years and writings:

| Value | His Words |
|-------|-----------|
| **True Organic** | "Almost organic isn't organic at all, believe me." |
| **Accessibility** | "We've always priced what we sell so people could afford it." |
| **Generosity** | "If anyone couldn't afford it, we would find ways to make it affordable, or even free." |
| **Direct Relationships** | CSA model over corporate middlemen |
| **Land Stewardship** | Commitment to permanent organic agriculture |

*Consider: Which of Don's values does Tiny Seed Farm want to carry forward?*

## HOW TO CREATE YOUR VALUES

### Step 1: Gather Raw Material
From the mission collaboration worksheets, pull:
- Words that appeared multiple times
- Behaviors people said they were proud of
- Things people said "we should never compromise"

### Step 2: Group Into Themes
Cluster similar ideas. Look for 3-5 major themes.

### Step 3: Name Each Value
Choose clear, memorable words. Avoid jargon.

### Step 4: Define What It Means HERE
Generic definitions don't help. Be specific to Tiny Seed Farm.

### Step 5: Add Real Examples
Show the value in action with actual stories from the farm.

### Step 6: Test It
- Is it true today? (Not just aspirational)
- Is it distinctive? (Not every farm could say this)
- Is it actionable? (Helps make decisions)
- Is it memorable? (Team can recall it)

## DISPLAYING VALUES

### Where to Post
- [ ] Barn / workspace (visible to team)
- [ ] Website "About" page
- [ ] Employee handbook
- [ ] CSA welcome packet
- [ ] Market signage (abbreviated)

### How to Use
- Reference in team meetings
- Include in job postings
- Mention when recognizing good work
- Use to explain difficult decisions

## VALUES vs. RULES

| Values | Rules |
|--------|-------|
| Principles | Specific behaviors |
| Guide judgment | Remove judgment |
| Flexible application | Rigid application |
| "Act with integrity" | "Clock in by 7:00 AM" |

**Values inform rules, but they're not the same thing.**

A values-driven culture needs fewer rules because people understand the principles.

---

## ANNUAL VALUES CHECK

Each year at season end, ask:
1. Did we live these values?
2. Which value was hardest to practice?
3. Do these still reflect who we are?
4. Should anything change?
