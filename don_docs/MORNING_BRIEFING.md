# Morning Briefing: Don Knowledge Base Analysis
## For Todd Wilson - January 16, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

I analyzed **247 emails** (86MB) from the Don Lease History archive plus all uploaded documents. Here's what you need to know:

### The Bottom Line

**Don is genuinely on your side.** He's made public commitments to hundreds of former CSA members about land trust and your long-term lease. The relationship is supportive and fair. The main risk is **informality**, not intent.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Public Commitments (STRONG)

Don has written to **hundreds of former CSA members** stating:

> "The farm will remain in a land trust and Todd will have a long-term lease where he can continue to grow organic produce indefinitely."

> "We can give the highest endorsement to Todd and the quality of the produce he's been growing."

These are documented, public statements. They carry moral weight even without legal force.

### 2. Cost Structure (REASONABLE)

From July 2023 invoice discussion:
- Electric (cooler): 10% share
- Equipment: Percentage-based on usage
- Fuel: Actual cost at year-end
- Housing: $12,000/year if needed
- **No explicit per-acre land rent visible** - seems cost-sharing focused

### 3. Land Trust Plan (STATED BUT UNSPECIFIED)

Don has repeatedly stated intention to donate to farmland trust, but:
- No organization named
- No timeline specified
- No lease terms within trust defined

### 4. No Formal Lease Exists

Despite 3 years of operations, terms are tracked via spreadsheet, not signed agreement.

## Don's Values (Why This Matters)

From his writings, Don values:

1. **Land preservation** - 50 years of organic stewardship
2. **Community over commerce** - "CSA means Community Sponsored Agriculture"
3. **Fighting corporate co-option** - "Corporations have farm-washed their produce"
4. **Accessibility** - "We've always priced so people could afford it"
5. **Fairness** - "just want to make it fair and transparent"

**Translation:** Don is philosophically aligned with supporting your success, not extracting maximum value.

3. Discuss multi-year field assignments

### For Your Protection
1. Keep copies of all correspondence
2. Document any verbal agreements via follow-up email

---

## Questions to Ask Don

1. "When do you expect the land trust to be formalized?"
2. "Which organization will hold the trust?"
3. "What would the lease terms be within the trust?"
4. "Can we document our current arrangement in writing?"
5. "Would you be open to multi-year field assignments?"

---

## My Assessment

**Don is a good-faith partner.** His actions match his words - he's actively recruiting customers for you, sharing expertise, and publicly committing to your long-term tenure.

**The risk is informality, not malice.** Formalizing the arrangement protects both parties and honors what you've already built together.

**Your position is strong:**
- 10+ year relationship
- Public endorsement from Don
- Stated land trust commitment
- 3 years of successful operations
- Maria stepping back simplifies orchard

**Recommendation:** Approach formalization as "documenting what we've already agreed to" rather than "negotiating new terms."
