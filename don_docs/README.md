# Don's Knowledge Base

This folder contains documents, analysis, and extracted wisdom from Don's 40 years of farming experience.

## Folder Structure

- **`/raw/`** - Original documents uploaded by owner (Don's spreadsheets, notes, plans)
- **`/analyzed/`** - Analysis notes for each document
- **`/extracted/`** - Clean data extracted from documents (CSVs, structured data)
- **`/recommendations/`** - Implementation recommendations for Tiny Seed OS

## Document Workflow

1. Owner uploads Don's original documents to `/raw/`
2. Don_Knowledge_Base Claude analyzes and catalogs in `/analyzed/`
3. Actionable data extracted to `/extracted/`
4. Integration recommendations written to `/recommendations/`
5. All wisdom compiled into `DONS_WISDOM.md`

## How to Add Documents

Simply place Don's documents in the `/raw/` folder and notify Don_Knowledge_Base Claude. Supported formats:
- Spreadsheets (.xlsx, .csv)
- PDFs
- Text/Notes (.txt, .md)
- Images of handwritten notes (will do our best)
