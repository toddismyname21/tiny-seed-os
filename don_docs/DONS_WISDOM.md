## Business Practices

### CSA Model Philosophy
From Don's letter to past CSA members:

> "CSA stands for Community Sponsored (or Supported) Agriculture... We need your support."

**Key Principles:**
1. **Direct relationship with customers** - Not filtered through corporations
2. **Affordable pricing** - "We've always priced what we sell so people could afford it"
3. **Accessibility** - "If anyone couldn't afford it, we would find ways to make it affordable, or even free"
4. **True local** - Fight against "farm-washing" by corporations

### Market Challenges Identified
1. Grocery stores want cheapest possible prices
2. National organic suppliers outcompete local
3. Minimum order sizes exclude small farms
4. Farmers' markets alone aren't sufficient
5. "Harvey Pittsburgh" and similar services = "CSA-washing"
6. Consumers trained to expect any produce year-round

### Pricing Philosophy
- Price for accessibility, not maximum profit
- Donate to food banks and shelters
- Provide options at multiple price points
- Value long-term customer relationships over short-term sales

### Customer Engagement Strategies
1. Newsletter to CSA members
2. Encourage customer advocacy at grocery stores
3. Multiple pickup locations (Squirrel Hill, Farm, Wexford)
4. Minimum 10 CSAs to open new pickup site

## Operational Systems

### Employee Guidelines
From "General Guidelines and Walk-around-the Farm":

**Punctuality & Professionalism:**
- Be ready to work at start time
- Work boots required (rubber boots only for wet conditions)
- No foul language
- Sign in/out on timesheet (greenhouse, right of door)
- 30-minute lunch break deducted from hours

**Resource Management:**
- Minimize garbage - no regular pickup
- Compost anything that breaks down
- Recycle #1 and #2 plastics, glass, aluminum, tin
- Never burn plastic
- Return all tools to proper storage

**Vehicle Use Hierarchy:**
1. Walk (if nearby, no carrying needed)
2. Gardenway cart or bicycle
3. Golf cart
4. Truck (last resort)
- Stay on established pathways
- Don't drive across fields
- Turn 4WD vehicles gradually on corners

**Parking Priority:**
1. Graveled areas (gas/diesel tanks, front of house, front of barn)
2. Roadway past barn (center, not heavy use times)
3. Grass (last option) - rotate spots, avoid wet areas

**Water & First Aid:**
- All water potable in greenhouse and barn
- Coolest water: east side of barn near manhole
- First aid in greenhouse medicine cabinet
- Pond is deep - be careful

### Weekly Planning Template
Structure includes:
- Week of date
- Prioritized Tasks list
- Daily sections (Monday-Saturday)
- Calls/Dates to track
- Buy list

## Soil Management

### 2024 Soil Test Results (Waypoint Analytical)

#### Field Summary
| Sample | Use | pH | Organic Matter | Key Needs |
|--------|-----|-----|----------------|-----------|
| DH | Apples | 6.4 | 5.0% | Good - needs P2O5, K2O |
| F4 | Apples | 6.1 | 5.0% | Needs 1 ton dolomitic lime, P, K |
| XY | Apples | 6.5 | 5.9% | Needs P2O5, K2O, S |
| VH | Apples | 6.7 | 5.7% | Good - needs P2O5, K2O, S |
| F3L | Garden-Home | 6.0 | 4.8% | Needs 1.5 tons dolomitic lime |
| JL | Alfalfa Hay | 7.1 | 5.1% | Needs high K2O (270 lb/acre) |

#### Key Soil Characteristics
- **High organic matter** across all fields (4.8-5.9%) - excellent for organic production
- **Estimated N Release**: 129-150 lbs/acre from organic matter
- **Cation Exchange Capacity**: 9.9-15.1 meq/100g (good to very good)
- Generally good Ca:Mg ratios

#### Fertilizer Recommendations
- Use **dolomitic lime** where pH correction needed
- Apply **ammonium sulfate** as N source to supply sulfur
- Sidedress vegetables with 1.5-2.5 lb N/1000 sq ft for leafy greens, tomatoes, peppers, corn
- Sidedress 0.5-1.5 lb N/1000 sq ft for peas, beans, melons, cucumbers, root crops
- On tomatoes: Don't apply additional N until first fruit set are half-dollar size

#### Fruit Tree Guidelines (from report)
- Apple nitrogen: 0.03-0.04 lb N/tree/year of growth
- Total N should not exceed 0.40-0.50 lb/tree/year
- Apply nitrogen during dormancy
- Target new growth: 10-18" per year

## Pest Management

### Groundhog Control
Detailed snare-making instructions from Don:

**Supplies:**
- 1x19 3/64 galvanized aircraft cable
- Newt's master lock 3/64"
- Wire snare swivels 11 gauge
- Aluminum stops 1/16"
- Source: snareone.com

**Key Points:**
- Cut 28" pieces of cable
- Create 6-8" long by 4-5" high oval snare
- Place snare just off ground, away from hole sides
- Use small twigs/sticks to guide groundhog into trap
- Size of snare is important - smaller than you'd think

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Works
1. **High organic matter** - 40+ years of organic practices built soil to 5-6% OM
2. **Paper pots** - Efficient for many crops, especially onion family
3. **Succession planting** - Key for continuous harvest
4. **Multiple varieties** - Hedge against failures
5. **Direct customer relationships** - CSA model builds loyalty
6. **Employee guidelines** - Clear expectations prevent problems

### What's Challenging
1. **Orchard sustainability** - Hard to find orchardists, especially organic
2. **Competing with corporate organic** - Price pressure from national suppliers
3. **Grocery store relationships** - Long lead times, price-focused
4. **Wholesale markets** - "Cutthroat" conditions
5. **Consumer expectations** - Year-round availability mindset

### Timeless Principles (Don's Philosophy)
1. Care for the land first
2. Price for accessibility, not just profit
3. Build community, not just customer base
4. Fight farm-washing and CSA-washing
5. Organic certification matters - "Almost organic isn't organic at all"
6. Support local organic fruit producers especially (fruit is harder to grow organic)
7. Donate what you can't sell to those in need
