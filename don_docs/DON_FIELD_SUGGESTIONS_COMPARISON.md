## SUMMARY

| Field | Don's Suggestion | Current Plan | Status |
|-------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| JS1 | Tomatoes & Peppers | Beets, Carrots, Herbs, Squash | **MISMATCH** |
| Z3 | Spinach, Greens → Beans | Spinach, Greens, Beans | **MATCHES** |
| Z1 | Potatoes | (No crops assigned) | **NEEDS PLANNING** |
| JS10 | Winter Squash, Watermelon | Peppers, Tomato | **SWAPPED w/ JS1** |
| JS6 | Onions, Cucumbers, Eggplant | Cucumber, Squash, Melon | **PARTIAL** |
| M | Early Carrots, Beets, Favas, Salanova | Carrots, Beets, Favas, Lettuce | **MATCHES** |
| CL | Perennial Flowers | (Not assigned) | **NEEDS PLANNING** |

---

## DETAILED COMPARISON

### JS1 - Currently: Mixed Vegetables
**Don's Recommendation:** Tomatoes & Peppers
- Rationale: Valuable crops, richest field, easier water access

**Current Plan:** Beets, Carrots, Cilantro, Dill, Lettuce, Parsley, Scallions, Winter Squash

**Analysis:** Don suggests swapping - JS1's rich soil and water access makes it ideal for high-value toms/peppers. Current plan has these in JS10 instead.

**Action Needed:** Consider swapping JS1 ↔ JS10 assignments

---

### Z3 - Currently: Greens & Beans
**Don's Recommendation:** Early herbs, spinach, small direct greens → followed by beans

**Current Plan:** Arugula, Beans, Petite Kale Mix, Radishes, Something Fresh Mix, Spinach, Turnip

**Analysis:** Current plan aligns well with Don's suggestion. He mentions doing half-acre spinach successions double-cropped with beans.

**Status:** Good alignment - no changes needed

---

### Z1 - Currently: No Crops Assigned
**Don's Recommendation:** Potatoes
- Rationale: Rough ground from sod, spuds can handle it, good N from alfalfa
- Future: Rotate into early greens/beans 2027 when ground is tamer

**Current Plan:** Field exists (70x450ft, 17 beds, Veg) but no crops in PLANNING_2026

**Analysis:** Field was just added to system. Don's potato recommendation makes sense for breaking in new ground.

**Action Needed:** Add potato varieties to Z1 for 2026, plan greens/beans rotation for 2027

---

### JS10 - Currently: Tomatoes & Peppers
**Don's Recommendation:** Winter Squash, Watermelon on plastic

**Current Plan:** Peppers, Tomato

**Analysis:** This appears to be a swap situation - Don wants toms/peppers in JS1 and squash/melon in JS10. Worth discussing the reasoning.

**Action Needed:** Consider swapping with JS1

---

### JS6 - Currently: Mixed Cucurbits
**Don's Recommendation:** Plastic: Onions, Cucumbers, Eggplant (rowcover the cucs/eggplant)

**Current Plan:** Celtuce, Cucumber, Lettuce, Summer Squash, Watermelons, Winter Squash

**Analysis:** Partial match - cucumbers are there. Missing onions and eggplant. Has squash varieties Don didn't mention for this field.

**Action Needed:** Discuss adding onions/eggplant, possibly move some squash to JS10

---

### M - Currently: Early Season Mix
**Don's Recommendation:** Very early carrots, beets, favas, salanova (could rowcover salanova)

**Current Plan:** Arugula, Basil, Beets, Carrots, Cilantro, Dill, Fava Beans, Lettuce, Peas, Petite Kale Mix, Something Fresh Mix, Spinach

**Analysis:** Strong alignment! Current plan includes all of Don's recommended crops (carrots, beets, favas, lettuce/salanova). Has additional early-season items.

**Status:** Good alignment - no major changes needed

---

### CL (Near Hotbeds) - Currently: Not Planned
**Don's Recommendation:** Perennial flowers - "be where they can be enjoyed by household"

**Current Plan:** Field exists (120x20ft, 5 beds, Floral) but no crops assigned

**Analysis:** Field was just added to system as Floral. Ready for perennial flower planning.

**Action Needed:** Add perennial flower varieties to CL

**Note:** Don also mentions "CL below rosemary" as future hoophouse location

---

## DON'S ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Walk Off Fields
> "Important to walk off fields to see how many rows/beds/black plastic sheets intended fields can accommodate b/c no use seeding more than field can accommodate"

**Action:** Physical field verification recommended before finalizing seed orders

### Favas Placement
Don suggests thinking about favas differently:
- Waste of fine tillage beds (good for tiny seeds)
- Could work as precursor to late sunflowers in "rougher" field
- Consider the "wasted triangle" for early tilling + second crop in June
- Note: Triangle would be dry later in summer

### Eggplant Note
Don prefers oriental types over Italian - faster second crop, easier to distribute numerically, recommends rolades as simple preparation.

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate
1. **Discuss JS1/JS10 swap** with Don - his rationale for toms/peppers in richer soil
2. **Add potatoes to Z1** - align with Don's recommendation for rough ground
3. **Plan CL perennial flowers** - what varieties?

### Before Seed Ordering
4. **Physical field walk** - verify bed counts match planning
5. **Reconcile JS6** - onions/eggplant vs current squash plans
6. **Fava placement** - current M plan or move to rougher field?

### Future Planning
7. **Z1 rotation 2027** - greens/beans when ground is tamer
8. **CL hoophouse** - below rosemary location for future infrastructure

| Field | Don's Note | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| "Wasted triangle" | Early till → June second crop | Not identified in system |
| CL (below rosemary) | Future hoophouse | Separate from hotbed CL? |
