# Letter of Support Request
## For Fruit Guys Grant Application

**To:** Don Kretschmann
**From:** Todd Wilson, Tiny Seed Farm
**Date:** January 23, 2026
**Re:** Request for Letter of Support

---

## Dear Don,

I'm applying for a grant through the Fruit Guys Foundation and would greatly appreciate a letter of support from you as my landlord and mentor.

### About the Grant

The Fruit Guys Foundation supports small-scale organic farmers through grants that help with:
- Infrastructure improvements
- Equipment purchases
- Business development
- Sustainable farming practices

### What I'm Requesting

A brief letter (1 page) on your letterhead that confirms:

1. **Our lease arrangement** - That Tiny Seed Farm leases approximately 12 acres from Kretschmann Farm
2. **Duration of relationship** - Our farming relationship dating back to 2013 when I worked as your employee, and the current lease since 2022
3. **Your endorsement** - Your confidence in my farming abilities and business viability
4. **Long-term commitment** - Your intention to provide long-term land access via the farmland trust

### Why This Helps

Grant reviewers want to see:
- Stable land tenure (your letter confirms this)
- Experienced mentorship (your history with me)
- Community support (your active endorsement)

### For Loan Applications Too

Thank you for providing your spreadsheets showing how you calculate our expenses and the lease fees. This documentation is exactly what lenders need to see for the loan applications I'm pursuing (FSA, Farm Credit). Having clear records of our arrangement makes a significant difference in getting approved.

### Sample Points to Include (Optional)

You could mention:
- The length of our relationship (10+ years)
- Quality of my farming (your endorsement letters to CSA members say this beautifully)
- Your commitment to the land trust / long-term lease
- The farm's organic certification status

### Timeline

If possible, I'd need the letter by **[DATE - please specify your deadline]** for the grant application.
