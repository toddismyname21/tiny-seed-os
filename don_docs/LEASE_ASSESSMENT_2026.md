## SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Formalize Written Agreement

**Current:** Terms tracked informally via spreadsheet and email
**Suggested:** Simple written lease summary (1-2 pages)

**Why:**
- Protects both parties if memory differs
- Required documentation for loan applications
- Provides clarity for land trust transition

**Proposed Terms to Document:**
- Annual field assignments
- Equipment use rates
- Shared cost percentages
- Duration (annual with renewal expectation)
- Land trust transition timeline

---

### 2. Multi-Year Field Assignments

**Current:** Fields assigned year-to-year
**Suggested:** 3-year field rotation commitments

**Why:**
- Enables long-term soil improvement investments
- Better crop rotation planning
- Supports perennial plantings (herbs, asparagus, berries)

**Proposed:**
- Designate "core fields" for 3-year cycles
- Flexible additional acreage as available
- Annual review meeting each December

---

### 3. Clarify Base Land Rent

**Current:** Not explicitly stated (embedded in cost-sharing?)
**Suggested:** Document whether base rent exists or arrangement is pure cost-share

**Why:**
- Needed for loan applications
- Tax documentation purposes
- Clarity for both parties

**Industry Comparison:**
- PA vegetable land typically $200-500/acre/year
- Current arrangement appears significantly below market (favorable to tenant)
- Cost-share model is unusual but works well for startup operations

---

### 4. Land Trust Timeline

**Current:** Public commitment to donate land to trust with long-term lease for Todd
**Suggested:** Document target timeline and process

**Questions to Clarify:**
- Which land trust organization?
- Target year for donation?
- Will lease terms change post-donation?
- What happens during transition period?

---

### 5. Equipment Rate Documentation

**Current:** "Readjust as the year goes on"
**Suggested:** Annual rate card with quarterly review

**Proposed Format:**
| Equipment | Hourly Rate | Fuel Included? |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Large tractor | $XX/hr | No |
| Small tractor | $XX/hr | No |
| Implements | Included | - |

---

## WHAT I'M NOT ASKING TO CHANGE

This assessment is **not** a request to renegotiate favorable terms. The current arrangement is:

- **Fair** - Cost-share model vs. fixed rent is reasonable
- **Supportive** - Don's mentorship and customer referrals are invaluable
- **Secure** - Land trust commitment provides long-term stability
- **Flexible** - Ability to grow acreage as business grows

The suggestions above are about **documentation**, not renegotiation.

---

## FOR LOAN APPLICATIONS

Lenders (FSA, Farm Credit) will ask for:

1. **Written lease agreement** - Even a simple one
2. **Rent amount** - Or equivalent value of cost-share
3. **Lease duration** - Multi-year preferred
4. **Landlord information** - Contact for verification

**Suggestion:** Create a simple "Letter of Understanding" that documents current terms without changing them. This satisfies lender requirements while preserving the informal, trust-based nature of our arrangement.

---

## PROPOSED NEXT STEPS

1. **Schedule annual review meeting** (30-60 minutes)
2. **Create simple written summary** of current terms
3. **Document 2026 field assignments** formally
4. **Discuss land trust timeline** when convenient

---

## APPRECIATION

Don, your support over the past three years has been instrumental in rebuilding Tiny Seed Farm. The combination of land access, equipment sharing, customer referrals, and mentorship is rare in agricultural leasing.

These suggestions are meant to protect and formalize what's working - not to change the collaborative nature of our arrangement.

Thank you.
