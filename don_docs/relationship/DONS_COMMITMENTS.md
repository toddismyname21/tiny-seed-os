## MAJOR COMMITMENTS

### 1. Land Trust Donation

**Commitment:** Don will donate the farm to a community farmland trust

**Evidence:**

From September 2024 letter ("A plea for the future of our farm"):
> "We're on the path to donating the land itself to a community farmland trust to be leased on a permanent basis to the next generation of farmers."

From January 2025 letter to former CSA members:
> "In a nutshell, the farm will remain in a land trust and Todd will have a long-term lease where he can continue to grow organic produce indefinitely."

From February 2025 letter:
> "We will donate the land itself to a community farmland trust to be leased on a permanent basis to the next generation of farmers."

**Status:** Stated intention, not yet executed
**Questions:**
- Which trust organization?
- Timeline for donation?
- Terms of lease within trust?

### 2. Long-Term Lease for Todd

**Commitment:** Todd will have a long-term lease to farm indefinitely

**Evidence:**

From January 2025 letter:
> "Todd will have a long-term lease where he can continue to grow organic produce indefinitely."

**Status:** Public commitment, no signed lease
**Note:** This is a significant public statement to hundreds of former CSA members

---

### 3. Fairness & Transparency

**Commitment:** Don wants the arrangement to be fair and transparent

**Evidence:**

From December 2022 email:
> "I have schemas for machinery use valuations etc. which I used last year for Victory. Would have to wrap my head around how to do that for more intermittent use, but just want to make it fair and transparent."

**Status:** Ongoing practice - Don tracks costs, adjusts percentages

---

### 4. Endorsement of Todd

**Commitment:** Don publicly endorses Todd's farming

**Evidence:**

From January 2025 letter (sent to hundreds of former customers):
> "We can give the highest endorsement to Todd and the quality of the produce he's been growing. In the 10 years since he left us to launch Tiny Seed Farm, he's been supplier to many of the best restaurants in the 'burgh."

> "He's quite adventurous in trying new crops-- the variety is simply astonishing."

**Status:** Active and ongoing - Don continues to recruit CSA members for Todd

---

### 5. Organic Certification Maintenance

**Commitment:** Don maintains organic certification for the property

**Evidence:**

From April 2024 email:
> "I'll be sending in the organic certification docs and I need that [list of seeds, inputs from Todd]."

**Status:** Active - Don handles certification, Todd provides documentation

---

### 6. Equipment & Infrastructure Access

**Commitment:** Todd has access to farm equipment and infrastructure

**Evidence:**

From multiple emails discussing:
- Tractor use (percentage-based)
- Cooler use (10% electric share)
- Box truck access
- Greenhouse propagation space
- Migrant worker housing available ($12,000/year)

**Status:** Active arrangement, tracked via spreadsheet

---

### 7. Apple Orchard Inclusion

**Commitment:** Apples will be part of Todd's CSA

**Evidence:**

From February 2025 letter:
> "Our apples will be included in the CSA."

**Status:** Active - Maria stepped back, apples transferring to Todd's operation

---

## IMPLICIT COMMITMENTS (From Behavior)

### 8. Customer Recruitment Support
Don actively sends emails to former CSA customers encouraging them to sign up with Tiny Seed Farm.

### 9. Mentorship
Don shares expertise, forwards relevant articles, provides guidance on farming practices.

### 10. Flexibility on Acreage
Todd has been able to expand from ~1.35A to ~12A over three years by requesting additional fields.

---

## STATED VALUES (Context for Commitments)

From Don's writings, he values:

1. **Land preservation:** "We're on the path to donating the land itself to a community farmland trust"

2. **Organic integrity:** "Almost organic isn't organic at all, believe me"

3. **Community over commerce:** "It goes back to the very meaning of CSA—Community Sponsored (or Supported) Agriculture"

4. **Accessibility:** "We've always priced what we sell so people could afford it"

5. **Fighting corporate co-option:** "Corporations have farm-washed their produce offerings"

6. **Long-term stewardship:** Nearly 50 years of organic farming on same land

---

## RED FLAGS / AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY

### 1. No Signed Agreement
Despite public commitments, no formal lease agreement has been signed.

### 2. Land Trust Details Unspecified
- Which organization?
- When?
- What lease terms within trust?

### 3. Year-to-Year Field Assignments
Fields assigned annually, not multi-year commitment.

### 4. "Readjust as the year goes on"
Equipment percentages are fluid, could lead to disputes.

### 5. Complex History with Apples
Maria's involvement created complexity; now simplifying but history exists.

---

## WHAT'S MISSING

Items that would strengthen Todd's position:

1. **Signed lease agreement** with specific terms
2. **Land trust timeline** and organization identification
3. **Multi-year field assignments** in writing
4. **Equipment rates** documented annually
5. **Succession provisions** if Don becomes incapacitated
6. **Right of first refusal** if plans change

---

## SUMMARY

**Don has made PUBLIC, WRITTEN commitments to:**
- Donate land to trust
- Give Todd long-term lease
- Support Todd's business success

**These are documented in letters sent to HUNDREDS of former CSA members.**

**However:**
- No formal signed agreement exists
- Details remain unspecified
- Arrangement is largely trust-based

**Assessment:** Don's intentions appear genuine and generous. The risk is in the informality, not the intent.
