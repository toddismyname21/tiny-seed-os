## Most Important Emails

### 1. Initial Field Agreement (December 16, 2022)

**From:** Don to Todd
**Subject:** RE: Apple/Field agreement

> "Here's some things I have, but we should talk again for sure.
>
> Ready to go fields would be O--.5A 400x45', F3M--.5A 290x55', and JS3--.35A 275x55'. O and F3M were cropped last year for the first of 3 yr production cycle; currently have rye covers. JS3 is alfalfa just across line near trellised orchard.
>
> See the apple charts marked in yellow the trees I believe Maria is not interested in for cider.
>
> Also see beta lease. I have schemas for machinery use valuations etc. which I used last year for Victory. Would have to wrap my head around how to do that for more intermittent use, but **just want to make it fair and transparent.**
>
> Would have to think through special considerations for apples. Something to think about is who will prune. I would certainly trust you, but if you have an idea you'd simply spend a day training a person and then let that person take over, I'd have misgivings. Some hybrid. Also how to value an established orchard?"

**Significance:** First documented lease discussion, establishes Don's fairness principle

### 2. First Invoice Discussion (July 3, 2023)

**From:** Don to Todd
**Subject:** bill

> "Here's the invoice I've come up with and the worksheet which shows how the machinery and land/infrastructure numbers were calculated.
>
> Electric was a guessimate as to what cost is to run the cooler (of course your part is just 10%). For %ages of use of tractors, we'll readjust as the year goes on. And there will be a charge for gas and diesel at the end of the year when the tanks are refilled.
>
> Have wracked my brain for how to do apples. Both because what we'd originally thought never happened and there will likely be a huge crop, I think the best way would be to calculate a certain amount per bushel, then subtract an amount reflecting your hours pruning and picking."

**Significance:** Establishes cost structure - 10% electric, percentage-based equipment, per-bushel apples

### 3. Public Commitment Letter (December 31, 2024 / January 2025)

**From:** Don to former CSA members (HUNDREDS of recipients)
**Subject:** Getting the farm band back together again

> "Holiday Greetings from the Kretschmanns,
>
> As life continues to throw the normal range of challenges our way—no discount for age—we've been blessed over the last two years to have a former employee, Todd, return to lease land from us and continue to produce beautiful organic vegetables.
>
> **In a nutshell, the farm will remain in a land trust and Todd will have a long-term lease where he can continue to grow organic produce indefinitely.**
>
> We can give the highest endorsement to Todd and the quality of the produce he's been growing. In the 10 years since he left us to launch Tiny Seed Farm, he's been supplier to many of the best restaurants in the 'burgh. He's quite adventurous in trying new crops-- the variety is simply astonishing.
>
> Todd is interested in expanding his CSA and asked us to contact prior subscribers.
>
> P.S. This year, there's the warm fuzzy feel like getting the band back together, as Todd is recruiting several of our longtime Mexican workers to help him."

**Significance:** PUBLIC commitment to land trust and long-term lease - sent to HUNDREDS of people

### 4. A Plea for the Farm's Future (September 9, 2024)

**From:** Don to former CSA members
**Subject:** A plea for the future of our farm

> "Since we retired after the 2020 season, we've been searching for the right farmer(s) to continue farming this 80 A of Western PA which we've had the privilege of loving and caring for these nearly 50 years. **We're on the path to donating the land itself to a community farmland trust to be leased on a permanent basis to the next generation of farmers.** The good news is that currently we have a former employee, leasing about 5 A and growing a wide variety of organic vegetables, much as we had done for decades. He's planning on expanding production next season.
>
> ...
>
> It goes back to the very meaning of CSA—Community Sponsored (or Supported) Agriculture. You were the reason we could farm profitably and sustainably all these years. We need your support now if our orchard is to survive.
>
> ...
>
> Corporations have farm-washed their produce offerings--'The Farmers Market at Giant Eagle'. Some have even CSA-washed their businesses. The love of place implicit in locally grown food has been prostituted."

**Significance:** First public mention of land trust plan, explains Don's values and motivations

### 5. Organic Certification Request (April 12, 2024)

**From:** Don to Todd
**Subject:** seed you used 2023-4

> I'll be sending in the organic certification docs and I need that."

### 6. Mentorship Discussion (December 19, 2022)

**From:** Todd to Don
**Subject:** Re: Apple/Field agreement

> "I talked to Dan Dalton today, and he was telling me there is grant funding for mentor/mentee relationships and I thought it might be an interesting way for me to learn a little bit more from you, and compensate you for your time. This would be especially beneficial since I will be growing on your property this coming season.
>
> I know you are retired, but I would be grateful if we could formalize a little bit of time for that."

**From:** Don's response:
> "Thinking about how to make this work well for the farm and all of us."

**From:** Don's response:
> "Might not need them at all because you're plowing down alfalfa. Thinking of the field below the goats. Might take a walk through to see how much alfalfa is there."

**Significance:** Shows field assignment process - Todd requests, Don considers rotation
