# Proposal for Formalizing Farm Stewardship
## Tiny Seed Farm at Kretschmann Farm

**Prepared by:** Todd Wilson, Tiny Seed Farm
**Date:** January 2026
**For Discussion with:** Don & Becky Kretschmann

---

## Preamble

Over the past three years, we have built a collaborative farming arrangement that honors the Kretschmanns' 50 years of organic stewardship while allowing Tiny Seed Farm to grow and serve the community. Don and Becky have been incredibly supportive - from endorsing our work to former CSA members, to sharing equipment and expertise, to planning for long-term land security through a farmland trust.

This proposal seeks to **formalize what is already working well** while providing clarity and protection for both parties as we plan for the next decade and beyond.

## Ten-Point Stewardship Plan

### 1. Written Stewardship Agreement

**Proposal:** Create a simple written agreement that documents our current arrangement.

**What It Would Include:**
- Named parties and property description
- Current acreage under cultivation
- Duration (suggest 5-year initial term with renewal options)
- Termination provisions (reasonable notice period for both parties)
- Dispute resolution process (conversation first, then mediation if needed)

**Why:** A written agreement protects both parties and provides clarity. It doesn't need to be a complex legal document - even a 2-3 page letter of understanding signed by both parties would suffice.

---

### 2. Multi-Year Field Assignment Plan

**Proposal:** Establish a 3-year rolling field plan rather than year-to-year assignments.

**Structure:**
- Year 1: Assigned production fields
- Year 2: Planned rotation/expansion
- Year 3: Projected fields based on crop rotation cycle

**Benefits:**
- Allows investment in soil improvements with confidence
- Enables perennial plantings (herbs, asparagus, rhubarb)
- Supports cover crop planning aligned with your existing 3-year rotation
- Provides predictability for business planning

**Flexibility:** Either party can propose adjustments with reasonable notice (e.g., 6 months).

---

### 3. Clear Cost Structure Documentation

**Proposal:** Document the cost-sharing arrangement in a simple annual schedule.

**Current Understanding (to be confirmed):**
| Category | Structure |
|----------|-----------|
| Land Use | [To be defined - currently appears minimal/none] |
| Electric (cooler) | 10% of utility cost |
| Equipment Use | Percentage based on usage |
| Fuel (gas/diesel) | Actual gallons used at current price |
| Greenhouse Space | [To be defined] |
| Water/Irrigation | [To be defined] |
| Migrant Housing | $12,000/year if utilized |

**Request:** Annual review meeting each January to confirm rates and settle any year-end adjustments.

---

### 4. Equipment Use Protocol

**Proposal:** Formalize equipment access and responsibility.

**Elements:**
- List of equipment available for Tiny Seed Farm use
- Usage tracking method (log book or simple app)
- Maintenance responsibilities (routine vs. major repairs)
- Fuel tracking system
- Protocol for equipment damage or breakdown
- Insurance/liability clarity

**Current Equipment Used:**
- Tractors (specify which)
- Cooler
- Box truck
- Greenhouse propagation space
- [Others to be listed]

---

### 5. Land Trust Integration Plan

**Proposal:** Clarify the timeline and terms for the planned farmland trust.

**Questions to Address:**
- What organization will hold the trust?
- Target date for trust establishment?
- What will the lease terms be within the trust structure?
- Will current informal terms convert to formal trust lease?
- What protections exist for Tiny Seed Farm's tenure?
- How are improvements (if any) handled?

**Request:** A conversation about the trust timeline and how our current arrangement will transition into the formal trust structure.

---

### 6. Organic Certification Partnership

**Proposal:** Document the organic certification arrangement.

**Current Practice:**
- Kretschmann Farm maintains organic certification
- Tiny Seed Farm provides required documentation (seed sources, inputs, etc.)
- Produce sold under organic certification

**Formalization:**
- Written commitment to maintain organic practices
- Documentation requirements and deadlines
- Process if certification is ever at risk
- Future option: Tiny Seed Farm obtains own certification if needed

**Acknowledgment:** Don's management of certification is valuable and appreciated.

### 7. Apple Orchard Stewardship

**Proposal:** Clarify the apple arrangement now that Maria has stepped back.

**Options to Discuss:**

**Option A - Full Integration:**
- Tiny Seed Farm assumes responsibility for designated orchard sections
- Apples included in CSA shares
- Pruning, spraying, harvest managed by Tiny Seed
- Revenue to Tiny Seed Farm

**Option B - Shared Stewardship:**
- Tiny Seed manages day-to-day orchard care
- Revenue sharing arrangement (e.g., % to Kretschmanns)
- Don provides technical guidance

**Option C - Separate but Coordinated:**
- Clear division of which trees belong to which operation
- Documented in orchard map
- Separate marketing channels

**Request:** A clear decision on orchard structure going forward.

---

### 8. Infrastructure Investment Framework

**Proposal:** Establish guidelines for infrastructure improvements.

**Questions:**
- What improvements can Tiny Seed Farm make?
- Who pays for what?
- What happens to improvements if lease ends?
- Can Tiny Seed Farm invest in tunnels/greenhouses?

**Suggested Framework:**
- Movable improvements (caterpillar tunnels, etc.): Tiny Seed Farm owns, can remove
- Permanent improvements: Discuss case-by-case, document ownership
- Soil improvements: Considered contribution to farm health, non-removable

---

### 9. Succession & Continuity Planning

**Proposal:** Document mutual intentions for the long term.

**Elements:**
- Right of first refusal if land ever sold (before trust completion)
- Process if Don/Becky can no longer manage landlord responsibilities
- What happens if Todd can no longer farm
- Emergency contacts and decision-making authority

**Intent:** Ensure the farm continues as organic farmland regardless of what happens to either party.

---

### 10. Annual Review & Communication

**Proposal:** Formalize our already-good communication with a simple annual structure.

**Annual Meeting (January):**
- Review prior year
- Settle any cost adjustments
- Plan field assignments for coming year
- Discuss any needed changes to agreement
- Document decisions in brief written summary

**Ongoing:**
- Continue current email/phone communication
- Major decisions documented in writing
- Quarterly check-ins if helpful

---

## Implementation Approach

**Phase 1 (Next 30 Days):**
- Have initial conversation about this proposal
- Identify which points need discussion vs. quick agreement
- Prioritize most important items

**Phase 2 (Next 90 Days):**
- Draft simple written agreement covering agreed points
- Review with advisors if desired (PASA, attorneys, etc.)
- Sign initial stewardship agreement

**Phase 3 (Ongoing):**
- Implement annual review process
- Adjust as needed based on experience
- Integrate with farmland trust when established

---

## Closing

Don and Becky, your support over these past years has been extraordinary. From your endorsement letters to former CSA members, to sharing your decades of wisdom, to planning for the farm's permanent protection - you've demonstrated a commitment to this land and its future that goes far beyond a typical landlord-tenant relationship.

This proposal isn't about changing what works. It's about documenting our shared understanding so we can build on it with confidence. The farm deserves stewards who are aligned in vision and clear in their commitments. I believe we already are - this just puts it on paper.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to continue the organic farming tradition you've built, and I look forward to discussing how we can formalize this partnership for the years ahead.

With respect and appreciation,

**Todd Wilson**
Tiny Seed Farm
