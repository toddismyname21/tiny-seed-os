## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment: POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH INFORMAL STRUCTURE**

The email correspondence reveals a supportive, mentor-like relationship where Don is actively invested in Todd's success. However, the lease arrangement appears largely informal, which creates both flexibility and some uncertainty.

**Key Findings:**
- Don provides strong support and endorsement of Todd
- Land trust plan secures long-term tenure
- Lease terms are tracked via spreadsheet but no formal contract visible
- Field assignments vary year-to-year
- Cost-sharing appears reasonable but complex

## Lease Structure (As Observed)

### Field Assignments
Initial fields offered (Dec 2022):
- **O Field:** 0.5 acres (400' x 45')
- **F3M Field:** 0.5 acres (290' x 55')
- **JS3 Field:** 0.35 acres (275' x 55')

**Key Quote from Don (Dec 2022):**
> "Ready to go fields would be O--.5A 400x45', F3M--.5A 290x55', and JS3--.35A 275x55'. O and F3M were cropped last year for the first of 3 yr production cycle; currently have rye covers."

**Field Assignment Process:**
- Don assigns fields based on rotation cycle and availability
- Fields change year-to-year
- Todd can request additional fields (e.g., "fall brassicas" request)
- Don considers crop rotation and cover crop status

### Cost Structure (from July 2023 invoice email)

| Item | Structure | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Electric (cooler) | 10% of cost | "Guessimate" - adjustable |
| Tractor use | Percentage-based | Readjusted as year progresses |
| Gas/Diesel | Year-end charge | When tanks are refilled |
| Apples | Per bushel minus labor credits | Complex - see below |
| Infrastructure | Unknown | Mentioned in "worksheet" |
| Land | Unknown | Not visible in emails |

### Migrant Worker Housing
- Available at $12,000/year (Jan 2025 email)

### Apple Arrangement (Complex)
From Don's July 2023 email:
> "Have wracked my brain for how to do apples. Both because what we'd originally thought never happened and there will likely be a huge crop, I think the best way would be to calculate a certain amount per bushel, then subtract an amount reflecting your hours pruning and picking."

**Issues with Apples:**
1. Todd pruned some trees (Pristines, Redfrees, Jonafrees)
2. Maria (Don's daughter) had separate cider business
3. Division of apple trees was unclear
4. Maria has since stepped back from farming

---

## What's Going Well

### 1. Strong Endorsement from Don
Don actively promotes Todd to former CSA customers:
> "We can give the highest endorsement to Todd and the quality of the produce he's been growing. In the 10 years since he left us to launch Tiny Seed Farm, he's been supplier to many of the best restaurants in the 'burgh."

### 2. Long-Term Security via Land Trust
From Don's letters to CSA members:
> "In a nutshell, the farm will remain in a land trust and Todd will have a long-term lease where he can continue to grow organic produce indefinitely."

This is a significant commitment - Don is structurally ensuring Todd's future on the land.

### 3. Mentorship Attitude
Don's stated approach:
> "Would have to wrap my head around how to do that for more intermittent use, but just want to make it fair and transparent."

### 4. Active Customer Recruitment
Don sends multiple emails to former CSA members encouraging them to sign up with Tiny Seed Farm.

### 5. Shared Resources
- Greenhouse space for seedling starts
- Equipment access (tractors, cooler)
- Box truck use
- Water/irrigation
- Don's farming expertise

### 6. Flexibility on Fields
Todd can request additional acreage as business grows.

## Areas of Concern / Questions to Address

### 1. Informal Documentation
**Observation:** No formal written lease visible in emails. Terms tracked via spreadsheet.

**Risk:** Verbal/informal agreements can lead to misunderstandings.

**Recommendation:** Consider formalizing key terms in writing, especially:
- Base land rent (if any)
- Equipment use rates
- Duration and renewal terms
- Field assignment process

### 2. Year-to-Year Field Variability
**Observation:** Todd asks Don for field assignments each season.

**Quote from Todd (April 2024):**
> "I would like to be assigned an additional field for my fall brassicas."

**Risk:** Less planning certainty; harder to invest in long-term soil improvements.

**Recommendation:** Establish multi-year field assignments where possible.

### 3. Complex Apple Arrangement
**Observation:** The apple/Maria/Todd situation was complicated and caused confusion.

**Quote from Don:**
> "Something to think about is who will prune. I would certainly trust you, but if you have an idea you'd simply spend a day training a person and then let that person take over, I'd have misgivings."

**Status:** Maria has stepped back; apples will now be included in Todd's CSA. This simplifies things going forward.

### 4. No Clear Per-Acre Rate
**Observation:** I could not find a specific $/acre land rent in the emails.

**What's Visible:**
- Electric: 10% share
- Equipment: percentage-based
- Gas/diesel: actual cost
- Housing: $12,000/year

**Question:** Is there a base land rent, or is this covered through equipment/infrastructure charges?

### 5. Organic Certification Responsibility
**Observation:** Don maintains the organic certification and asks Todd for documentation.

**Quote from Don (April 2024):**
> "Can you please send me a list of the seeds you used, where they came from and if they were organic or untreated. As well, production products used, like soil mix, sprays, fertilizers. I'll be sending in the organic certification docs and I need that."

**This is positive** - Don is managing certification overhead.

## Fairness Assessment

### FAVORABLE TO TODD:
1. **No apparent high land rent** - cost structure seems to focus on actual resource use
2. **Long-term security** - land trust commitment is exceptional
3. **Active customer recruitment** - Don's endorsement letters are marketing gold
4. **Equipment access** - tractors, cooler, greenhouse at shared cost
5. **Flexibility** - can request more acreage as business grows
6. **Organic certification** - Don maintains (saves Todd time and cost)
7. **Mentorship** - Don shares 40+ years of expertise freely
8. **Housing available** - for seasonal workers

### POTENTIALLY UNFAVORABLE:
1. **Informal structure** - could lead to disputes if relationship sours
2. **Year-to-year field assignments** - less planning certainty
3. **Complexity with equipment percentages** - adjustments could be contentious

### NEUTRAL/UNCLEAR:
1. **Specific costs** - spreadsheet not visible
2. **Apple arrangement** - was complex but simplifying now
3. **Long-term lease terms** - land trust details not fully specified

## Comparison to Industry Standards

### Typical Farm Land Lease Rates (PA/Midwest)
- Cropland cash rent: $50-200/acre/year
- Vegetable land (prime): $200-500/acre/year
- Orchard land: Varies widely

### Typical Lease Structures
- **Cash Rent:** Fixed $/acre
- **Crop Share:** Landowner gets % of harvest
- **Hybrid:** Lower cash rent + some product sharing

### Kretschmann Arrangement
Appears to be a **hybrid cost-sharing model** rather than traditional cash rent:
- Shared infrastructure costs (electric, equipment, gas)
- Field access provided
- Long-term security via land trust
- Landowner provides marketing support

**Assessment:** This arrangement seems designed to **reduce Todd's startup costs** while maintaining the farm's viability. It's more **partnership-oriented** than a typical tenant-landlord relationship.

## Recommendations

### For Todd:

1. **Document the Arrangement**
   Create a simple written summary of current terms, even if informal:
   - Fields currently assigned
   - Equipment use percentages
   - Shared cost structure
   - Land trust status/timeline

2. **Clarify Long-Term Field Planning**
   Ask about multi-year field assignments for perennial herbs, etc.

3. **Understand Land Trust Timeline**
   When will the trust be formalized? What are the lease terms within the trust?

4. **Get Equipment Percentages in Writing**
   The "readjust as the year goes on" approach could use clearer documentation.

5. **Celebrate What's Working**
   Don's active support and endorsement is extremely valuable. This relationship is an asset.

### For the Relationship:

1. **Annual Review Meeting**
   Discuss fields, costs, and plans once per year.

2. **Written Summaries**
   Even brief email confirmations of agreed terms creates documentation.

3. **Keep Communication Open**
   The email history shows good communication patterns - maintain this.

## Conclusion

**The business relationship appears fundamentally fair and healthy.**

Don is demonstrably invested in Todd's success - he's actively recruiting customers, planning to donate land to a trust with long-term lease for Todd, sharing 40+ years of expertise, and structuring costs around actual resource use rather than extracting maximum rent.

The main risks are related to **informality** rather than **unfairness**. Formalizing key terms would protect both parties without changing the collaborative nature of the arrangement.

The transition of apples to Todd's CSA (with Maria stepping back) should simplify the arrangement going forward.

**Bottom Line:** Todd appears to have a supportive, long-term-oriented landlord who is actively working to ensure his success. This is rare and valuable in agricultural leasing.
