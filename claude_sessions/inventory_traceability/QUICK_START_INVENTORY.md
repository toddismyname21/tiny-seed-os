## Speed Tips

### Do It Fast
- Don't overthink item names
- "Thing that does X" is fine
- Round value estimates
- Skip items worth <$10 unless many

### Batch by Area
- Finish one area completely
- Then move to next
- Don't backtrack

### Group Similar Items
- "Box of fittings - est. 100 pieces - $200 total"
- Don't photograph every fitting

### Condition Shorthand
- **G** = Good (works fine)
- **F** = Fair (works but worn)
- **P** = Poor (barely works)
- **R** = Needs Repair

## Help

**Can't decide category?** Pick "Other" - fix later.

**Item too small to matter?** Group with similar: "Misc hand tools - 15 items - $300"

**Bad lighting?** Flash on, or come back.

**Phone dying?** Charge and continue. Data auto-saves.
