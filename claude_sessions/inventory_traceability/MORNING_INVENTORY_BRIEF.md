## Route Suggestion

Most efficient path through farm:

```
1. Tool Shed (30 min)
2. Equipment Barn (30-45 min)
3. Greenhouse(s) (20-30 min each)
4. Field edges - irrigation, row cover (20-30 min)
5. Wash/Pack station (20-30 min)
6. Cold storage (15-20 min)
7. Seed storage (30-45 min) *use existing seed inventory if populated*
8. Amendment storage (15-20 min)
9. Office (10-15 min)
10. Vehicles (10 min)
```

**Total: ~3 hours typical**

## Categories You'll Use Most

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Equipment | Tractor, tiller, mower, sprayer |
| Tools | Shovels, hoes, harvest knives |
| Seeds & Transplants | Seed packets, trays |
| Irrigation | Drip tape, fittings, hoses |
| Packaging | Boxes, bags, labels |

Don't overthink it - pick closest match.

---

## Minimum Info Per Item

1. **Photo** - Snap it
2. **Name** - What is it?
3. **Quantity** - How many?
4. **Location** - Where is it?

Everything else is bonus. Get the basics, refine later.

---

## Skip These

- Individual small items (<$10)
- Broken items being disposed
- Personal belongings
- Crops in ground (separate system)

---

## Questions?

**"What category?"** → Pick closest, or "Other"

**"How much detail?"** → Less is more. "Misc hand tools - 15 items" is fine.

**"How accurate on value?"** → Round estimates: $50, $100, $500. Don't stress.

**"What if I miss something?"** → Add it later. Not a test.

---

## When You're Done

1. Review entries quickly
2. Note items needing repair
3. Let me know - I can help process/export

---

## Estimated Output

After inventory, you'll have:
- 50-200 items documented
- Photos of everything
- Location mapping
- Value estimates for insurance/accounting
- Repair/replace list

---

## Bottom Line

**Just start walking and photographing.**

Capture now, organize later. Done is better than perfect.

You've got this. 🌱
