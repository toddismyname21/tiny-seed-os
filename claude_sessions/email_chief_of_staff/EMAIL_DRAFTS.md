Hi Ashley,

I hope you're doing well. I'm following up on two items for Tiny Seed Farm LLC (Case #93818, Job Order 12366-1):

**1. fastTrack 10 Form**

Sonora mentioned in September that our fastTrack 10 was still outstanding. I want to make sure this gets completed right away. Could you please:
- Resend the FT10 form if needed, or
- Let me know exactly what information you need from me to complete it

I apologize for the delay on this.

**2. 2026 Season Renewal**

I received the enrollment portal link (portal.maslabor.com) back in October. I want to confirm:
- Is my 2026 renewal application complete in the portal?
- What's the timeline to get Juan Pablo Villasenor Ulloa and Juan Pablo de Jesus Villasenor Diaz back by April 1, 2026?
- Are there any outstanding items I need to submit?

Both workers were excellent last season and we're eager to have them return.

Please let me know what you need from me to keep things moving. I'm available by phone at [PHONE] or email anytime.

Thank you,

I also received the 2026 renewal packet (due February 15, 2026) and want to make sure I'm on track.

## EMAIL 3: OEFFA - Real Organic Project Partnership Inquiry

**TO:** organic@oeffa.org
**CC:** John Stock <john@oeffa.org>
**SUBJECT:** Real Organic Project Certification - OEFFA Partnership Inquiry (#3839)

---

Hello,

I'm Todd Wilson from Tiny Seed Farm LLC (Certification #3839). I'm interested in adding Real Organic Project certification to my existing OEFFA organic certification.

I understand OEFFA has a partnership with the Real Organic Project. Could you please provide information on:

1. How does the OEFFA-ROP partnership work?
2. Can I apply through OEFFA, or do I apply directly to ROP?
3. Is there any coordination between my OEFFA inspection and ROP inspection?
4. What additional documentation would I need beyond my current OSP?

Our farm is 100% soil-based (no hydroponics), and we meet all the ROP standards for whole-farm certification.

I'd like to pursue this certification for the 2026 growing season if possible.

Thank you,

Todd Wilson
