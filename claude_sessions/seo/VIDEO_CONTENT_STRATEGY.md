| Best Times | Saturday 9 AM, Weekday evenings 6-8 PM |

```

### 2. YouTube Shorts + Long-Form - HIGH PRIORITY

**Why:** YouTube content is highly cited by AI models like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews. This directly boosts AEO.

| Format | Frequency | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Shorts | 3-5x weekly | Quick hits, repurpose TikTok |
| Long-form | 1x weekly | Educational authority building |

**Long-Form Content Ideas:**
- "Complete Guide to CSA Membership" (10-15 min)
- "A Week in the Life of a Pittsburgh Farm" (8-10 min)
- "How We Grow: [Specific Crop]" series (5-8 min each)
- "Farm to Table: What Happens to Your CSA Box" (8-10 min)
- Seasonal wrap-up videos (end of season recap)

**SEO Tips for YouTube:**
- Use keywords in title: "Pittsburgh CSA Farm Tour"
- Detailed descriptions with timestamps
- Add closed captions (helps AI extract content)
- Create playlists by topic

---

### 3. Instagram Reels - MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Why:** Good for existing audience. Cross-post from TikTok to save time.

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Posting Frequency | 1x daily |
| Best Times | Tuesday 11 AM, Thursday 11 AM |
| Cross-post from TikTok? | Yes, remove TikTok watermark |

**Instagram-Specific Tips:**
- More polished aesthetic works better here
- Flower content performs well (@tinyseedfleurs)
- Use carousel posts for "What's in the box" content
- Stories for behind-the-scenes casual content

---

## THE 4 CONTENT PILLARS

Research shows the strongest strategies use 3-4 content pillars. Here's the breakdown:

### Pillar 1: Educational/How-To (30%)

**Purpose:** Build authority, help AEO, provide value

**Examples:**
- "How to store your CSA vegetables to last"
- "What is a CSA? Explained in 30 seconds"
- "3 ways to use [unusual vegetable]"
- "When to harvest [crop]"
- "How we grow organic [crop]"

**AEO Benefit:** This content gets cited by AI assistants when users ask questions.

---

### Pillar 2: Behind-the-Scenes (30%)

**Purpose:** Build connection, show authenticity, humanize the farm

**Examples:**
- 4:30 AM harvest crew checking in
- Packing 200 CSA boxes
- What farmers do when it rains
- Equipment maintenance day
- Team lunch break
- Greenhouse planting marathon

**Why It Works:** People want to see the humans behind their food. Authenticity > polish.

---

### Pillar 3: Trend Participation (20%)

**Purpose:** Tap into viral potential, reach new audiences

**How To:**
1. Check "For You" page for trending sounds/formats
2. Adapt trend to farm context within 48 hours
3. Use original audio when possible for discoverability

**Examples:**
- Trending sound + farm montage
- "POV" trends from farmer perspective
- Dance trends in the field
- "Things that just make sense" trends

**Speed Matters:** The first 48 hours of a trend are when it's most valuable. Don't overthink it.

---

### Pillar 4: Entertainment/Personality (20%)

**Purpose:** Show brand personality, be relatable, encourage shares

**Examples:**
- Farm fails and bloopers
- Weather complaint videos
- "Farmer problems" content
- Reaction to first frost
- Celebrating harvest wins
- Goofing around with team

**Why It Works:** Entertainment content gets shared. Shares = reach = growth.

---

## VIRAL FORMULA

### The Hook (First 1-2 Seconds)

**Critical:** You have 1-2 seconds to stop the scroll. Front-load the most interesting part.

**Hook Formulas:**
- Start with the payoff: "200 pounds of tomatoes!" (then show harvest)
- Bold claim: "This is why grocery store tomatoes taste like nothing"
- Question: "Ever wonder what 4 AM looks like on a farm?"
- Text overlay: "Wait for it..." / "Watch till the end"
- Visual shock: Unexpectedly beautiful or interesting shot

### The Content (Middle)

- Keep it moving - no dead time
- Use cuts every 2-3 seconds
- Text overlays help retention
- Background music at appropriate volume

### The CTA (End)

- Don't always hard sell
- Soft CTAs: "Follow for more farm content"
- Sometimes just end on a satisfying moment
- Save hard CTAs for 1 in 5 videos
