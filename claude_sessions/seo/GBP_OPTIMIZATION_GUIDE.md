## STEP 8: Q&A SECTION (Seed These Yourself)

Ask and answer these questions from your business account:

### Q1: How does your CSA work?
```
A: Our CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) provides weekly or biweekly shares of fresh, organic produce. Members sign up for a season (typically 20 weeks from late May to October), choose their share size and pickup location, and receive a box of freshly harvested vegetables each week. We have pickup locations throughout Pittsburgh including Mt. Lebanon, Squirrel Hill, Bloomfield, and more!
```

### Q2: What neighborhoods do you deliver to?
```
A: We offer CSA pickups in Mt. Lebanon, Squirrel Hill, Bloomfield, Shadyside, East Liberty, Lawrenceville, and the North Hills. We also offer home delivery throughout Allegheny County for an additional fee. Check our website for the full list of current pickup locations!
```

### Q3: Are you certified organic?
```
A: Yes! Tiny Seed Farm is certified organic. We follow strict organic growing practices and never use synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Our certification ensures every vegetable and flower meets the highest standards for organic production.
```

### Q4: How much does a CSA share cost?
```
A: Our CSA shares range from $400-700 for the full summer season (20 weeks), depending on share size. We offer small (1-2 people), regular (2-4 people), and family (4-6 people) sizes. This works out to $20-35 per week for farm-fresh, organic produce—often less than grocery store prices for conventional produce!
```

### Q5: Can I customize my CSA box?
```
A: Yes! We know everyone has different tastes. Members can set preferences to avoid certain items, and we offer swap credits at pickup to exchange items you don't want. Our Flex CSA option gives you complete control—use prepaid farm credit to choose exactly what you want each week.
```

### Q6: When does CSA season start?
```
A: Our main Summer CSA runs from late May through October (20 weeks). Signup typically opens in January-February, and shares often sell out by spring. We recommend signing up early to secure your spot! We also offer Spring and Fall CSA options for extended coverage.
```

### Q7: What's in a typical CSA box?
```
A: A typical summer box includes 8-12 items of seasonal produce. Early season: lettuce, spinach, radishes, herbs. Mid-summer: tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, zucchini, beans. Fall: winter squash, kale, carrots, beets. Every week is different based on what's freshly harvested!
```
