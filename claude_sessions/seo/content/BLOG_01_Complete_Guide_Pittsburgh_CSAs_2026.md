## What is a CSA and Why Are Pittsburgh Families Joining?

A CSA, or Community Supported Agriculture, connects you directly with a local farm. You pay upfront for a "share" of the harvest, then receive weekly boxes of fresh, seasonal produce throughout the growing season.

For Pittsburgh families, joining a CSA means:
- **Fresher produce** - Harvested hours before pickup, not days
- **Supporting local farms** - Your money stays in the Pittsburgh economy
- **Knowing your farmer** - See exactly where your food comes from
- **Eating seasonally** - Discover vegetables at their peak flavor
- **Better nutrition** - Studies show local produce retains more nutrients

In 2026, Pittsburgh has more CSA options than ever. Here's everything you need to know to find the right one for your family.

## How Does a Pittsburgh CSA Work?

### Step 1: Choose Your Share Size

Most Pittsburgh CSAs offer multiple share sizes:

| Share Size | Best For | Typical Contents |
|------------|----------|------------------|
| Small | Singles, couples | 4-6 items weekly |
| Regular | Small families (2-4) | 8-10 items weekly |
| Large/Family | Large families (4-6) | 12-15 items weekly |

### Step 2: Select Your Season

Pittsburgh's growing season runs roughly:
- **Spring CSA:** April - May (cool weather crops)
- **Summer CSA:** Late May - October (main season, 20 weeks)
- **Fall CSA:** September - November (storage crops)

Most CSA members join the Summer share, which offers the widest variety.

### Step 3: Pick Your Pickup Location

Pittsburgh CSAs typically offer multiple pickup locations throughout the city and suburbs. Common pickup neighborhoods include:
- Mt. Lebanon
- Squirrel Hill
- Bloomfield
- Shadyside
- Lawrenceville
- East Liberty
- North Hills

Some farms also offer home delivery for an additional fee.

### Step 4: Enjoy Your Weekly Box

Each week during the season, you'll pick up a box packed with whatever's freshest from the farm. Early season might include lettuce, radishes, and herbs. By mid-summer, expect tomatoes, peppers, corn, and zucchini. Fall brings squash, root vegetables, and hearty greens.

## How Much Does a Pittsburgh CSA Cost?

CSA pricing in Pittsburgh typically ranges from **$400-700 for a full summer season** (20 weeks), depending on share size and farm.

Here's how the math works out:

| Share Size | Season Cost | Per Week | Comparison to Grocery |
|------------|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| Small | $400-450 | $20-22 | Similar to conventional |
| Regular | $500-600 | $25-30 | Less than organic |
| Large | $650-750 | $32-37 | Much less than organic |

**The value proposition:** You're getting certified organic (or sustainably grown) produce for roughly the same price as conventional grocery store produce—and it's fresher, tastier, and supports local farms.

Many Pittsburgh CSAs also offer:
- **Payment plans** - Split into 2-4 payments
- **SNAP/EBT** - Some farms accept food assistance
- **Work shares** - Reduced cost in exchange for farm volunteer hours

## Is a CSA Right for Your Pittsburgh Family?

### A CSA is perfect if you:
- Want the freshest possible produce
- Enjoy cooking and trying new vegetables
- Value supporting local farmers
- Want your kids to understand where food comes from
- Are tired of tasteless grocery store tomatoes
- Care about sustainable, organic farming

### A CSA might not be right if you:
- Travel frequently during summer
- Have very picky eaters unwilling to try new things
- Prefer complete control over what you buy
- Can't commit to weekly pickups

**Pro tip:** If you're unsure, look for farms offering half-shares, biweekly pickups, or flex shares that give you more control.

## How to Get the Most From Your CSA

### 1. Meal Plan Around Your Box
When you pick up your share, take inventory and plan meals for the week. Use the most perishable items (greens, herbs) first.

### 2. Learn Proper Storage
Different vegetables have different storage needs. Root vegetables last weeks in the fridge. Tomatoes should stay on the counter. Greens need a damp towel in a sealed container.

### 3. Embrace the Unfamiliar
Getting a vegetable you've never cooked? That's part of the adventure! Your farm likely provides recipes, or search "[vegetable name] recipes" online.

### 4. Connect With Your Farm
Follow your farm on social media, attend farm events, and get to know the people growing your food. This connection is what makes CSA special.

### 5. Preserve the Abundance
During peak season, you might get more than you can eat fresh. Learn to freeze, can, or pickle the surplus for winter.
