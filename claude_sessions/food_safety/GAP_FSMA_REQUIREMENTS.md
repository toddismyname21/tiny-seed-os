# GAP & FSMA Requirements for Tiny Seed Farm
## Food Safety Research Document

**Prepared by:** Food_Safety Claude
**Date:** 2026-01-16
**Farm:** Tiny Seed Farm LLC, Rochester, PA (Beaver County)
**Certification:** OEFFA Certified Organic (#3839)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Is Tiny Seed Covered by FSMA or Qualified Exempt?

**LIKELY QUALIFIED EXEMPT** - but verification needed.

To qualify for exemption, Tiny Seed must meet BOTH criteria:
1. Average annual food sales < $500,000 (adjusted for inflation) over past 3 years
2. More than 50% of sales go to **qualified end-users**

**Qualified End-Users Include:**
- Direct consumers (CSA members, farmers market customers) ✓
- Restaurants within 275 miles of farm ✓
- Retail food establishments within 275 miles ✓

Based on Tiny Seed's sales channels (CSA, farmers markets, wholesale restaurants, home delivery), most/all sales likely qualify as direct to qualified end-users.

### ACTION REQUIRED
Owner must calculate:
- [ ] Average annual food sales (last 3 years)
- [ ] Percentage of sales to qualified end-users vs. distributors/out-of-area

**If qualified exempt:** Not subject to routine FDA inspections, but MUST:
1. Display farm name/address on all products
2. Keep records proving exemption eligibility
3. May still need GAP audit for wholesale restaurant buyers

   Rochester, PA 15074
   ```

2. **Record Keeping**: Maintain sales records proving:
   - Total food sales (3-year rolling average)

## WATER TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### If Covered by FSMA (Not Exempt)

#### Harvest & Post-Harvest Water (Well Water)
| Year | Testing Frequency |
|------|-------------------|
| Year 1 | 4 tests per water source |
| Subsequent Years | 1 test per year (if Year 1 passed) |

**Standard:** No detectable generic E. coli per 100 ml

**If test fails:** 4 new tests required

#### Pre-Harvest Agricultural Water (2024 Rule Update)
The FDA shifted from mandatory testing to a **systems-based assessment approach**:

1. Conduct agricultural water assessment evaluating:
   - Water source and system
   - Adjacent land use risks
   - Application method and timing
   - Produce type

2. Testing is now ONE TOOL in assessment, not primary requirement

3. If testing: Frequency and criteria must be "scientifically valid and appropriate"

#### Municipal Water
- No testing required
- Must keep documentation showing water meets standards

### If Qualified Exempt
- No federal water testing mandate
- However, **GAP audits still require water testing documentation**
- Recommended: Follow same standards for wholesale buyers

## GAP CERTIFICATION

### Why Tiny Seed May Need GAP Despite FSMA Exemption

**Market Access:** Many wholesale buyers (restaurants, grocery stores, institutions) require GAP certification as a condition of sale, regardless of FSMA status.

### USDA Harmonized GAP (H-GAP)

The standard most aligned with FSMA and commonly required by buyers.

#### Audit Structure:
| Scope | Coverage |
|-------|----------|
| Scope 1 | Farm Review (general practices) |
| Scope 2 | Field Harvest & Field Packing |
| Scope 3 | House Packing |
| Scope 4 | Storage & Transportation |

#### Passing Score:
- **80% compliance** on each applicable scope
- Corrective Action Needed items must be addressed by next audit

#### PA-Specific Benefits:
- On-Farm Readiness Reviews available FREE through PA Dept of Agriculture
- Non-enforcement, educational
- Call: 717-317-2057 to schedule

#### Cost Assistance:
- USDA has funding to offset GAP audit costs for specialty crop growers (2024-2025)
- Check current availability for 2026

### Documentation Needed for GAP Audit:
1. Written Food Safety Plan
2. Risk assessments (water, soil amendments, etc.)
3. Standard Operating Procedures
4. All 7 FSMA record categories
5. Traceability system documentation
6. Corrective action logs
