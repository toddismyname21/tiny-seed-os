## OVERNIGHT MISSION (Owner is sleeping - WORK AUTONOMOUSLY)

### PRIMARY ASSIGNMENT: LEASE RESEARCH SUPPORT + KRETSCHMANN DEEP DIVE

**You are partnering with Business_Foundation Claude on this.**

#### Your Research Focus

1. **Don Lease History Email Archive (86MB)**
   - Process the `Don Lease History.mbox` file
   - Extract all relevant correspondence about land, lease, succession
   - Document Don's stated intentions over time
   - Note any commitments or promises made
   - Timeline of the relationship

2. **Don's Philosophy & Values**
   - From his CSA letter and other docs, what does Don value?
   - How does he view the land's future?
   - What does "land trust" mean to him?
   - What's his vision for succession?

3. **Historical Context**
   - How long has Don farmed this land?
   - What's the history of the property?
   - Any previous succession attempts or discussions?

4. **Relationship Documentation**
   - Create `/don_docs/relationship/` folder
   - `TIMELINE.md` - Chronological history of Todd-Don relationship
   - `DONS_COMMITMENTS.md` - All stated intentions/promises
   - `CORRESPONDENCE_SUMMARY.md` - Key email excerpts

#### Support Business_Foundation Claude

They are creating THREE lease proposals. Provide them:
- Evidence of Don's intentions
- Quotes they can use
- Historical context
- Any red flags you find

#### Deliverable: MORNING BRIEFING

Create `/don_docs/MORNING_BRIEFING.md` with:
- Summary of what you found in correspondence
- Key quotes from Don
- Timeline of major events
- Recommended reading for owner

- Finalize the 627 sowing records for Field_Operations
- Package seed order data for Inventory_Traceability
- Create import-ready CSV files
- Document the data structure

---

### CHECK-IN PROTOCOL

Write to your OUTBOX when:
1. Email archive processing complete (or blocked)
2. Key findings documented

## YOUR DOMAIN

You are the knowledge curator for Don's 40 years of farming experience. Your job is to analyze his documents and extract wisdom to incorporate into Tiny Seed OS.

---

## CONTEXT

Don is an experienced farmer who has been farming for 40 years. He has shared documents and spreadsheets with valuable information. Your job is to:

1. Analyze all provided materials
2. Extract actionable insights
3. Identify what should be incorporated into the system
4. Preserve institutional knowledge

---

## ASSIGNED TASKS

### 1. Document Analysis Folder
**Priority: HIGH**

Create and organize:
```
/don_docs/
  /raw/           <- Owner uploads Don's originals here
  /analyzed/      <- Your analysis notes
  /extracted/     <- Clean data extracted from docs
  /recommendations/ <- What to implement
```

### 2. Document Inventory
**Priority: HIGH**

As documents come in:
- Catalog each document
- Note document type (spreadsheet, notes, plan, etc.)
- Summarize key content
- Rate relevance to system (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

### 3. Knowledge Extraction
**Priority: HIGH**

For each document, extract:
- **Crop-specific wisdom** (varieties, timing, techniques)
- **Business practices** (pricing, markets, customers)
- **Operational systems** (workflows, schedules, checklists)
- **Lessons learned** (what worked, what didn't)
- **Local knowledge** (PA-specific, regional markets, weather patterns)

### 4. Integration Recommendations
**Priority: MEDIUM**

For each insight, recommend:
- Which part of Tiny Seed OS should incorporate this
- How to implement (new feature, data entry, documentation)
- Priority level
- Which Claude should handle implementation

### 5. Knowledge Base Document
**Priority: MEDIUM**

Create a living document:
- `DONS_WISDOM.md` - Organized collection of insights
- Categorized by topic
- Searchable
- Referenced to original documents

---

## APPROACH

Don has 40 years of success. Treat his materials with respect:
- Don't dismiss anything as outdated without consideration
- Look for timeless principles, not just current practices
- Note what's PA/region-specific vs universal
- Flag anything that contradicts current system assumptions

---

## PM_ARCHITECT NOTE (2026-01-16)

**Excellent work on the initial analysis.** Your OUTBOX shows critical progress:

### Data Goldmine Discovered
- 627 Greenhouse Sowing Records (2024)
- 189 Seed Orders
- 6 Soil Test Results
- Complete variety database

### Integration Ready
Your recommendations are approved for handoff:
1. **Field_Operations Claude** → Sowing data, variety database
2. **Inventory_Traceability Claude** → Seed orders, supplier info

### Still Pending
- 86MB email archive (Don Lease History.mbox) - Process if time allows
- Owner approval to proceed with data import

### Context from Other Claudes
Business_Foundation discovered Don has made public commitments to Todd about long-term lease but never signed an agreement. This adds context to the Don-Todd relationship you may see in correspondence.
