## KEY FINDINGS FOR BUSINESS_FOUNDATION CLAUDE

### Don's Public Commitments (Use These)

**Land Trust:**
> "The farm will remain in a land trust"
> "We're on the path to donating the land itself to a community farmland trust to be leased on a permanent basis to the next generation of farmers."

**Long-Term Lease:**
> "Todd will have a long-term lease where he can continue to grow organic produce indefinitely."

**Endorsement:**
> "We can give the highest endorsement to Todd and the quality of the produce he's been growing."

**Fairness Principle:**
> "just want to make it fair and transparent"

### Evidence Strength
- **PUBLIC statements** sent to hundreds of former CSA members
- **Repeated** across multiple letters (Sep 2024, Dec 2024/Jan 2025, Feb 2025)
- **Documented** in email archive

### Red Flags/Uncertainties
1. No signed formal lease exists
2. Land trust organization not specified
3. Land trust timeline not specified
4. Lease terms within trust not defined
5. Year-to-year field assignments
6. Equipment percentages "readjust as the year goes on"

### Cost Structure Discovered
- Electric (cooler): 10% share
- Equipment: Percentage-based
- Fuel: Actual cost at year-end
- Housing: $12,000/year
- No explicit $/acre land rent visible

## ASSESSMENT

**Relationship is fundamentally positive.** Don is genuinely invested in Todd's success - his actions (customer recruitment, public endorsement, land trust plan) match his words.

**Risk is informality, not intent.** Recommend formalizing as "documenting what's already agreed" rather than "negotiating new terms."

**Todd's position is strong:**
- 10+ year relationship
- Public endorsement from Don
- Stated land trust commitment
- 3 years successful operations
- Maria stepping back simplifies orchard

---

## QUOTES WORTH PRESERVING

From Don's letters:

> "In a nutshell, the farm will remain in a land trust and Todd will have a long-term lease where he can continue to grow organic produce indefinitely."

> "We can give the highest endorsement to Todd and the quality of the produce he's been growing."

> "just want to make it fair and transparent"

> "It goes back to the very meaning of CSA—Community Sponsored (or Supported) Agriculture."
