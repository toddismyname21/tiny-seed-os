## Session 2 (2026-01-23): API Configuration Audit

### Goal
Verify all mobile files use `api-config.js` (not hardcoded URLs)

### Files Audited

| File | api-config.js | URL Pattern | Status |
|------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| employee.html | ✅ Has | Fallback pattern | ✅ Good |
| web_app/driver.html | ✅ Has | Fallback pattern | ✅ Good |
| web_app/csa.html | ✅ Has | Fallback pattern | ✅ Good |
| web_app/customer.html | ✅ Has | TINY_SEED_API.MAIN_API | ✅ Good |
| web_app/neighbor.html | ✅ Has | TINY_SEED_API.MAIN_API | ✅ Good |
| login.html | ✅ Has | Fallback pattern | ✅ Good |
| inventory_capture.html | ✅ Has | Fallback pattern | ✅ Good |
| web_app/farmers-market.html | ✅ Has | TINY_SEED_API.MAIN_API | ✅ Good |
| web_app/market-sales.html | ✅ Has | TINY_SEED_API.MAIN_API | ✅ Good |
| web_app/delivery-zone-checker.html | ✅ FIXED | Was hardcoded → Now fallback | 🔧 Fixed |

### Fallback Pattern Used
```javascript
const API_URL = (typeof TINY_SEED_API !== 'undefined')
  ? TINY_SEED_API.MAIN_API
  : 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/.../exec';
```

This pattern:
1. Uses `api-config.js` when available
2. Falls back to hardcoded URL if config not loaded
3. Prevents breaking if script fails to load

---

## Fix Applied

### delivery-zone-checker.html
**Issue:** Hardcoded API URL with no fallback or api-config.js include

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Added `<script src="api-config.js"></script>` to head
2. Changed `const API_BASE = '...'` to fallback pattern

---

## Current API URL
