## OVERVIEW

Forcing tulips allows harvest weeks or months before natural outdoor blooming. Total time from bulb to bloom: **18-22 weeks** (14-18 weeks chilling + 4 weeks forcing).

---

## TIMELINE SUMMARY

| Phase | Duration | Temperature | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Rooting | 2-3 weeks | 40-48°F | In darkness |
| Extended Chilling | 12-15 weeks | 34°F | Stack crates |
| Forcing | 4 weeks | 58-65°F | Greenhouse |
| **TOTAL** | **18-22 weeks** | | |

## STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

### STEP 1: RECEIVE & STORE BULBS (Fall)

**Timing:** Order bulbs in summer, receive in fall

**Storage before planting:**
- Cool, dry conditions
- Away from ethylene sources (fruit, exhaust)
- Do not refrigerate until ready to plant

**Supplies Needed:**
- Bulb crates (standard nursery crates)
- Labels
- Potting media (Pro-Mix or similar)

---

### STEP 2: PLANT BULBS IN CRATES

**Process:**
1. Fill crates with 2-3 inches of **moistened** potting media
2. Place **60-70 bulbs per crate** (spacing like "eggs in an egg carton")
3. Cover with 3 additional inches of soil
4. Water thoroughly until saturated
5. Label each crate: **Variety | Date In | Date Out**

**Critical Tips:**
- Saturate soil completely to prevent heaving during root development
- Flat side of bulb faces outward (stems will arch toward center)

---

### STEP 3: ROOTING PHASE (2-3 weeks at 40-48°F)

**Location:** Cooler, CoolBot room, or cold storage

**Requirements:**
- Complete darkness
- High humidity (90-95%)
- Protect from rodents
- Stack crates with 1-2" spacing for airflow

**Monitor:**
- Check top crates for drying
- Roots should begin emerging from drainage holes

---

### STEP 4: EXTENDED CHILLING (12-15 weeks at 34°F)

**Temperature:** As close to freezing as possible WITHOUT freezing

**Critical Rules:**
- **NEVER raise temperature** once lowered (triggers unwanted shoot growth)
- Maintain consistent temperature
- Continue monitoring moisture

**Chilling Requirements by Variety Type:**
| Variety Type | Total Chilling Weeks |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Early forcing | 14 weeks |
| Mid-season | 16 weeks |
| Late forcing | 18 weeks |

---

### STEP 5: MOVE TO GREENHOUSE (Forcing)

**Duration:** Approximately 4 weeks

**Temperature:** 58-65°F ideal
- Cooler = slower development, better quality
- Warmer = faster blooming
- **NEVER exceed 68°F** (causes stem topple)

**Watering:**
- Water heavily immediately after removing from cooler
- Maintain near-saturated soil
- Use drip irrigation to avoid bloom damage

**Light:** Natural daylength sufficient

**Ventilation:** Daily to manage temperature and humidity

**Fertilizer:** None required (bulb contains all nutrients)

---

### STEP 6: HARVEST

**Timing:** Blooms appear ~4 weeks after forcing begins

**Harvest Stage:**
- Cut when buds are colored but still closed
- Early morning is ideal
- Cut stem as long as possible (pull from bulb for extra length)

**Post-Harvest:**
- Place immediately in clean water
- Use bulb flower conditioner (Chrysal Clear Bulb)
- Store at 34-38°F

**Vase Life:** 7-10 days with proper conditioning

## COMMON PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Heaving bulbs** | Too warm during rooting | Lower to 32°F |
| **Early shoot growth** | Chilling temp too high | Reduce to 34°F |
| **Short stems** | Insufficient chilling, wrong variety | Ensure full chilling time |
| **Leggy stems** | Too much chilling, high forcing temp | Monitor weeks carefully |
| **Flower abortion** | Ethylene, high temp, dry soil | Control environment |
| **Stem topple** | >68°F forcing temp, calcium deficiency | Keep below 68°F |

## RECOMMENDED VARIETIES FOR FORCING

From Flower Spacing Guide:
- **Double Gudoshnik** - excellent double
- **Pink Impression Mix** - reliable
- **Angelique** - for early tunnel blooms

---

## ESTIMATED TIME PER TASK

| Task | Est. Time | Frequency |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Planting crates | 15 min/crate | Once per batch |
| Watering in cooler | 20 min | Weekly |
| Move to greenhouse | 30 min/20 crates | Once per batch |
| Greenhouse watering | 15 min | Daily |
| Harvest | 30 min/100 stems | As needed |

---

## SCHEDULE CALCULATOR

**Want blooms for Valentine's Day (Feb 14)?**
- Count back 4 weeks forcing = Jan 17 move to greenhouse
- Count back 16 weeks chilling = Sep 26 plant bulbs

**Want blooms for Mother's Day (May 11)?**
- Count back 4 weeks forcing = Apr 13 move to greenhouse
- Count back 16 weeks chilling = Dec 22 plant bulbs
