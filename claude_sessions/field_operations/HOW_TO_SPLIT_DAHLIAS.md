## OVERVIEW

Splitting (dividing) dahlia tubers multiplies your stock and improves plant health. One healthy clump can yield **5-20 new tubers** depending on variety and age.

**Estimated Time:** 2-5 minutes per tuber (after practice)

---

## WHEN TO SPLIT

### Option 1: FALL (After Digging)
**Pros:**
- Get it done while handling tubers anyway
- Smaller pieces easier to store
- Less spring work

**Cons:**
- Eyes may be hard to see
- More risk of rot in storage

### Option 2: SPRING (Before Planting) - RECOMMENDED
**Pros:**
- Eyes are **pronounced and visible** (sprouting)
- Can assess winter storage damage
- Plant immediately after dividing

**Cons:**
- More work during busy season

**Best Practice:** Wait until eyes are visible, usually **late February to April** in Zone 6

## ANATOMY OF A DAHLIA TUBER

Understanding anatomy is CRITICAL for success:

```
         STEM (old stalk)
              |
         ====|====
        /    |    \
      CROWN (eyes here!)
       |           |
      NECK        NECK
       |           |
     BODY        BODY
       |           |
     ROOTS       ROOTS
```

### Three Essential Parts:
1. **CROWN** - Where eyes (growth points) form. Connected to old stem.
2. **NECK** - Thin part connecting crown to body. FRAGILE!
3. **BODY** - The fat part storing energy and nutrients.

**CRITICAL RULE:** Each division MUST have:
- A piece of crown with a visible EYE
- An intact, unbroken NECK
- A BODY at least the size of your little finger

**If any part is missing = tuber will NOT grow**

## TOOLS & SUPPLIES NEEDED

### Required:
- [ ] Sharp bypass pruners or knife
- [ ] 70% isopropyl alcohol OR 10% bleach solution
- [ ] Container for sanitizing solution
- [ ] Clean work surface
- [ ] Labels and permanent marker
- [ ] Storage containers (paper bags, crates, or boxes)

### Helpful:
- [ ] Bucket of water for washing tubers
- [ ] Old toothbrush for cleaning
- [ ] Paper towels
- [ ] Sulfur powder (for cut surfaces)
- [ ] Magnifying glass (to find small eyes)

---

## STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

### STEP 1: PREPARE WORKSPACE

1. Set up clean work surface
2. Prepare sanitizing solution:
   - **Alcohol:** 70% isopropyl (use as-is)
   - **Bleach:** 1 part bleach to 10 parts water
3. Have all tools ready
4. Label containers for each variety

---

### STEP 2: WASH THE CLUMP

1. Remove tuber clump from storage
2. Gently wash off all soil with water
3. Use soft brush for stubborn dirt
4. Allow to air dry slightly (not completely)

**Why:** Clean tubers = see eyes better, prevent disease spread

---

### STEP 3: SANITIZE TOOLS

**THE #1 GOLDEN RULE: SANITIZE BETWEEN EVERY CLUMP**

Process:
1. Submerge pruners in alcohol for **10 seconds**
2. Let air dry (no need to wipe)
3. Repeat before EACH new clump

**Why:** Prevents spread of viruses and diseases between plants

---

### STEP 4: ASSESS THE CLUMP

Before cutting, examine:
1. **Locate the crown** - center top where stem was attached
2. **Find the eyes** - small bumps or pink/green sprouts on crown
3. **Check for damage** - rot, soft spots, broken necks
4. **Plan your cuts** - visualize divisions before cutting

**Eyes look like:**
- Small pink or green bumps
- Tiny pointed protrusions
- May be sprouting already in spring

---

### STEP 5: CUT CLUMP IN HALF

For large clumps:
1. Make bold cut through center of stem/crown
2. Cut straight down, dividing clump in two
3. This makes working with smaller pieces easier
4. Ensure each half has crown material with eyes

---

### STEP 6: DIVIDE INTO INDIVIDUAL TUBERS

Work systematically:
1. **Identify** an eyed tuber you can easily remove
2. **Cut** where neck meets crown, keeping 1 cm² of crown attached
3. **Stop and reassess** - find next easiest tuber
4. **Repeat** until clump is fully divided

**Cutting technique:**
- Make clean cuts (no crushing)
- Include small piece of crown with each tuber
- Cut at junction points, not through tubers

---

### STEP 7: REMOVE STEM REMNANTS

1. Cut off as much old stem as possible
2. Stem is common source of rot
3. Can harbor invasive insects

---

### STEP 8: TRIM AND INSPECT

For each divided tuber:
1. **Trim roots** - cut back all dangling roots
2. **Trim end** - slice thin piece off body end to check for rot
   - Healthy = white/cream colored inside
   - Rot = brown, soft, or hollow
3. **Discard** any tubers with:
   - Broken necks
   - No visible eye
   - Signs of rot
   - Bodies smaller than your pinky finger

---

### STEP 9: CURE AND STORE

**Curing (if dividing in fall):**
1. Let cut surfaces air dry for 24-48 hours
2. Optional: dust cuts with sulfur powder
3. Store in cool, dark place (40-50°F)
4. Use peat moss, vermiculite, or newspaper wrapping

**If dividing in spring:**
1. Pot up immediately in 4" pots
2. Keep warm (60-70°F) to encourage sprouting
3. Water sparingly until growth appears

## SIZE REQUIREMENTS

**Minimum size:** Little finger (AAA battery size)

| Size | Result |
|------|--------|
| Too small (<pinky) | May grow but fewer/smaller flowers |
| Ideal (thumb size) | Strong plant, good flowers |
| Large (fist size) | Can often divide further |

**"Blind" tubers** (no eye visible) = discard or wait to see if eye develops

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Not sanitizing tools** | Spreads viruses between plants | Dip in alcohol between EVERY clump |
| **Breaking the neck** | Tuber won't grow without connection | Handle gently, cut carefully |
| **No eye on division** | Won't produce a plant | Always verify eye before cutting |
| **Cutting too small** | Weak plant, few flowers | Keep pieces thumb-sized minimum |
| **Leaving stem attached** | Causes rot in storage | Remove all stem material |
| **Storing wet tubers** | Promotes rot | Allow to dry before storing |

---

## ESTIMATED TIME

| Task | Time | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Setup and prep | 10 min | Once per session |
| Wash clump | 2-3 min | Per clump |
| Divide clump | 5-10 min | Per clump, yields 5-20 tubers |
| Pot up divisions | 3-5 min | Per tuber |

**Example:** 20 dahlia clumps = approximately 2-3 hours
**Potential yield:** 100-300 new tubers!

---

## SPRING POTTING SCHEDULE

After dividing in late winter/early spring:

| Week | Task |
|------|------|
| Week 0 | Divide and pot up in 4" pots |
| Week 1-2 | Keep warm (60-70°F), water sparingly |
| Week 2-4 | Eyes should sprout, begin regular watering |
| Week 4-6 | Move to greenhouse, harden off |
| After last frost | Transplant to field |
