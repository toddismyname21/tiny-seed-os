## SECTION 2: BEST PRACTICES FOR WHOLESALE SELLING

### The Golden Rules

1. **Consistency is King** - Chefs need reliable supply. If you can't deliver consistently, they'll go back to their distributor.

2. **Communication is Everything** - Chefs need frequent updates. Failing to communicate will get you blacklisted fast.

3. **Never Deliver During Service** - Avoid 11am-2pm and 5-10pm. You'll inconvenience the chef and lose the sale.

4. **Sell Your Story** - Restaurants want to sell a story as much as your produce. Emphasize the human connection vs. wholesalers.

5. **Samples Speak Louder Than Words** - Bring free samples to every prospective meeting.

---

### Target the Right Restaurants

**Ideal Targets:**
- Farm-to-table focused restaurants
- High-end establishments with seasonal menus
- Chef-owned restaurants
- Places that already feature local producers

**Why:** They're most forgiving of harvest fluctuations and have branding in place to capitalize on local produce.

**Research Tip:** Check restaurant websites, Instagram, and menus for "local," "seasonal," or farm names before approaching.

---

### Building Chef Relationships

**First Contact:**
- Start at farmers markets - let chefs come to you
- Drop off samples with a price list (not during service!)
- Be politely persistent - may take several attempts

**Pre-Season Planning:**
- Schedule meetings BEFORE the season starts
- Bring seed catalogs to plan together
- Ask: "What products sell best? What can't you find?"
- Offer consistent pricing throughout the season

**Ongoing Relationship:**
- Host harvest dinners or farm tours
- Invite kitchen staff to planting/harvest days
- Include them in production planning
- Remember: you're partners, not just vendors

---

### Communication Best Practices

**Weekly Updates:**
- Send availability lists every Monday
- Include what's coming in 1-2 weeks
- Note any supply issues early
- Provide alternatives when items are short

**Delivery Protocol:**
- Set a consistent delivery schedule
- Define minimum order requirements upfront
- Provide emergency contact for urgent issues
- Give ample notice if you can't deliver

**When Things Go Wrong:**
- Communicate EARLY if there's a supply issue
- Always offer alternatives
- Never surprise a chef with missing items

---

### Pricing Strategy

**Know Your Numbers:**
- Calculate true cost of production per item
- Typical farm markup: 10-200% above cost
- Wholesale discount: Usually 30-50% off retail

**Industry Standard Margins:**
- Grocery stores: 40-70% markup on wholesale
- Restaurants: Target 25-35% food cost

**Negotiation Tips:**
- Ask chef what they pay their wholesaler - match if reasonable
- Offer consistent pricing throughout season (chefs love this)
- Volume discounts for larger orders
- Premium pricing for specialty items they can't get elsewhere

**Price Flexibility:**
- Unique pricing per customer is normal
- Consider volume, contract length, payment terms
- Produce is tiny % of chef's costs - they'll pay for quality

---

## SECTION 3: WHAT CHEFS WANT IN 2025-2026

### Top Chef Priorities

1. **Quality & Freshness** (Your biggest advantage!)
   - Local = harvested days ago, not weeks
   - Consistent appearance and flavor
   - Set internal quality standards

2. **Reliability**
   - On-time delivery, every time
   - Clear schedule and minimum orders
   - Emergency contact available

3. **Transparency & Traceability**
   - "Who grew this? Where did it come from?"
   - Farm story for menu descriptions
   - Food safety certifications (GAP!)

4. **Flexibility**
   - Seasonal menus = they adapt to what you have
   - Some chefs let farms dictate the menu
   - Be ready for climate/weather changes

---

### Current Market Trends (2025-2026)

- **25% of chefs** have shifted to buying more local
- **24% already** buy predominantly local
- **35%** use a mix of local and national suppliers
- **Nearshoring** is hot - restaurants avoiding supply chain delays
- **AI-powered** supply chain tools making sourcing easier

---

### What Makes You Stand Out

**Tiny Seed Farm Differentiators:**
- GAP certification ready (pre-harvest inspection system!)
- FSMA 204 traceability (lot codes, chain of custody)
- Year-round mushroom supply
- Signature salad mixes with creative names
- 120+ product variety
- Multiple pepper varieties (15!)
- Specialty items: Celtuce, Tatsoi, Edible Flowers

---

## SECTION 4: TALKING POINTS FOR YOUR MEETING

### Your Farm Story (Have This Ready!)
- Family/history of the farm
- Why you do what you do
- What makes your growing practices special
- Your commitment to quality and food safety

### Key Selling Points
1. "We have GAP-compliant food safety systems"
2. "Full lot-code traceability - we can track any item back to the field"
3. "120+ products across all categories"
4. "Year-round mushroom supply"
5. "Signature salad mixes exclusive to us"
6. "Pre-season planning - we can grow what you need"

### Questions to Ask the Wholesale Manager
1. What products are you having trouble sourcing?
2. What quality issues do you have with current suppliers?
3. What's your ideal delivery schedule?
4. What certifications do your accounts require?
5. What volume commitments can we discuss?
6. How do you prefer to communicate (text, email, phone)?

### Red Flags to Watch For
- Wants to pay net-60 or longer
- Won't commit to any volume
- Wants exclusive but won't guarantee purchases
- Unrealistic quality expectations without premium pricing
