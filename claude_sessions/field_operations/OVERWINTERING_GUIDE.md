## WHAT IS OVERWINTERING?

Overwintering means planting hardy annuals and biennials in fall to survive winter and bloom earlier the following spring. Benefits:

- **Earlier blooms** - 4-6 weeks ahead of spring-sown
- **Stronger plants** - Established root systems
- **Extended harvest** - Longer cutting season
- **Less spring work** - Plants already established

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Plants yellow in spring | Nutrient deficiency | Side-dress with nitrogen |
| Rot at crown | Too wet, poor drainage | Improve drainage, reduce watering |
| No flowers | Too much nitrogen, not enough cold | Reduce fertilizer, ensure vernalization |
| Stunted growth | Root damage from frost heaving | Mulch heavily, firm soil |
| Aphid infestation | Common on cool-season crops | Spray with insecticidal soap early |
