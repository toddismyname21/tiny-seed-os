## QUESTIONS FOR OWNER

### About Current Operations
1. **Dahlia varieties:** Which dahlia varieties does the farm currently grow? How many clumps to split this spring?

2. **Tulip forcing:** Is there cooler/cold storage infrastructure for tulip forcing? CoolBot room capacity?

3. **Overwintering infrastructure:** Does the farm have:
   - Low tunnels?
   - Caterpillar tunnels?
   - High tunnel space for flowers?

4. **Ranunculus/Anemones:** Are these currently grown? Interest in adding?

5. **Lisianthus:** This requires December seeding and 70°F germination. Is this feasible?

### For Loren (Flower Manager)
1. Which crops are highest priority for task tracking?
2. What additional how-to guides would be helpful?
3. Any specific varieties to add to the guides?

---

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Today)
1. Review the 3 how-to guides with Loren
2. Print FLOWER_CRITICAL_DATES.md for wall reference
3. Confirm dahlia splitting timeline (Feb 15-Mar 15)

### This Week
1. Inventory dahlia tuber storage
2. Order any missing supplies (pruners, alcohol, pots)
3. Check tulip bulb orders for forcing

### This Month
1. Start lisianthus seeds (if doing this year)
2. Pre-sprout ranunculus/anemone corms
3. Plan spring dahlia bed locations
