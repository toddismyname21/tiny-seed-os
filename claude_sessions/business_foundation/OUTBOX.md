## DELIVERABLE 1: LEASE PROPOSALS

### Three Distinct Proposals Ready

| Proposal | Approach | Term | Key Feature |
|----------|----------|------|-------------|
| **A: Conservative** | Maximum legal protection | 10 years | 24-month termination notice |
| **B: Collaborative** | Partnership model | 5 years | Rent-to-own equipment path |
| **C: Land Trust** | 99-year equitable lease | 3 yrs → 99 yrs | Matches Don's stated vision |

### Research Findings

| Topic | Key Finding |
|-------|-------------|
| **Market Rates** | Todd pays $500/acre vs PA avg $108 - premium but includes infrastructure |
| **Land Succession** | Land For Good offers free coaching; non-family transfers increasing |
| **Land Trusts** | Agrarian Commons 99-year model matches Don's public commitment |
| **Tax Benefits** | Don could save $500K+ via conservation easement deduction |

### Recommendation
**Start with Proposal B, work toward Proposal C.** Preserves relationship while building toward the land trust structure Don publicly promised.
