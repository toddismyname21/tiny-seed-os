## WHAT I BUILT

### 1. Season Audit System

**Why:** Owner said 2025 was a "transitional year with significant losses." Before committing to the $500K 2026 goal, we need to understand what happened.

**Files:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SEASON_AUDIT_2025.md` | Comprehensive audit template with 8 sections |
| `TEAM_SURVEY_2025.md` | 8-section retrospective survey for all team members |
| `CROP_PROFITABILITY_TEMPLATE.md` | Per-crop analysis for cost-based pricing |

**Ready for:**
- Financial data input (from QuickBooks)
- Production data input (from harvest records)
- Team survey distribution

### 2. Collections System

**Why:** Alberta's Food Group situation ($6,045 over 16 months) should never happen again.

**Files:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `COLLECTIONS_POLICY.md` | Complete credit/collections policy with tiers, escalation process, templates |
| `SMALL_CLAIMS_GUIDE_PA.md` | Step-by-step guide if Alberta's doesn't pay by Jan 23 |

**Key features:**
- Credit tiers (Prepay → Net 14 → Net 30)
- Credit application form
- Escalation timeline (automatic suspension at 30 days)
- AR aging report template
- Full Small Claims process with evidence checklist
