## OVERNIGHT DELIVERABLES

### Research Completed

| Topic | Key Finding |
|-------|-------------|
| **Market Rates** | Todd pays $500/acre vs PA average $108/acre - premium but includes infrastructure |
| **Land Succession** | Land For Good offers free coaching; non-family succession is increasing |
| **Land Trusts** | Agrarian Trust 99-year lease model matches Don's stated vision |
| **Tax Benefits** | Don could deduct 100% of income for 15 years via conservation easement |

### Three Proposals Created

| Proposal | File | Philosophy |
|----------|------|------------|
| **A: Conservative** | `proposals/PROPOSAL_A_CONSERVATIVE.md` | Maximum legal protection, 10-year term |
| **B: Collaborative** | `proposals/PROPOSAL_B_COLLABORATIVE.md` | Partnership approach, rent-to-own path |
| **C: Land Trust** | `proposals/PROPOSAL_C_LAND_TRUST.md` | 99-year equitable lease via land trust |

### Morning Reading List

**Location:** `/business_docs/lease/MORNING_READING_LIST.md`

Includes:
- Summary of all research findings
- Comparison of three proposals
- My recommendation (B → C path)
- Key talking points for Don conversation
- Resource links
- Next steps checklist

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**Start with Proposal B, work toward Proposal C.**

- Proposal B preserves the relationship while providing security
- Proposal C is what Don publicly committed to
- The combination gives Todd immediate security and long-term vision

---

## KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS

### Market Rate Reality

Todd is paying 5x the PA state average per acre ($500 vs $108), BUT:
- Includes greenhouse, tunnels, barn, coolers, equipment
- Turnkey organic operation
- Equipment alone worth $100K+

**Verdict:** Fair for what's included, but no security justifies the premium.

### Land Trust Model Discovered

The Agrarian Commons model provides:
- 99-year leases (effectively permanent)
- Rent based on farm viability, not speculation
- Farmer governance on board
- Inheritable to chosen successor
- Land permanently protected

**This is exactly what Don told his CSA members he would do.**

### Tax Benefits for Don

If Don donates or sells to a land trust:
- 100% income tax deduction (farmer rate)
- 15-year carryforward
- Potential $500,000+ in tax savings
- Estate tax reduction
- USDA may match 50% of easement value

## CAPITAL EXPENSES DISPUTED

Owner has documented $2,175+ in capital expenses paid that were Don's responsibility:

| Item | Amount |
