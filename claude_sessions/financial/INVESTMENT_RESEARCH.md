## Part 1: Traditional Investment Strategies

### Momentum Investing

**What It Is:** Buy assets that have performed well recently, expecting continued performance.

**Recommended Implementation:**
- **12-1 Month Momentum**: Rank stocks by 12-month return, excluding most recent month
- Quarterly or annual rebalancing (monthly is for professionals)
- Portfolio of 50-100 stocks for best results

**Key ETFs:**
| ETF | Name | Focus |
|-----|------|-------|
| MTUM | iShares MSCI USA Momentum | Large-cap momentum |
| QMOM | Alpha Architect US Quantitative Momentum | Pure momentum factor |

**Performance Context:** Momentum has historically outperformed S&P 500 over long periods. Works best in trending markets.

---

### Value + Momentum Combination

**Why Combine:** They perform well at different times. Value does well in recoveries; momentum does well in trends.

**Implementation:**
- 50% Value ETF (VTV, VLUE)
- 50% Momentum ETF (MTUM, QMOM)
- Annual rebalancing

**Benefit:** Similar returns to pure momentum with fewer painful drawdowns.

---

### Mean Reversion Trading

**What It Is:** Bet that prices will return to their average after extreme moves.

**Best Indicators:**
- Bollinger Bands (buy below lower band, sell above upper)
- RSI below 30 = oversold (buy signal)
- RSI above 70 = overbought (sell signal)

**Best Markets:** Range-bound, volatile periods. NOT strong trends.

**Hold Period:** 3-7 days typically

**Risk Warning:** Strong trends can exceed "extreme" levels for extended periods. Use stop losses.

## Part 3: Congressional Trading Analysis

### Overview

Members of Congress must disclose stock trades within 45 days (STOCK Act). Multiple tools track these disclosures.

### Tools Available

| Tool | Best For | Cost |
|------|----------|------|
| **Quiver Quantitative** | Advanced analysis, data export | Free |
| **Capitol Trades** | Clean, simple dashboard | Free |
| **Unusual Whales** | Options & politician tracking | Paid |

### Performance Data (2025)

**Quiver's "Congress Buys" Strategy:**
- 2025 YTD Return: **+31%**
- CAGR Since Inception: **35.4%**
- Outperformed S&P 500

**Top Holdings in Strategy (Late 2025):**
| Stock | Weight | Congress Purchases | Total Value |
|-------|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| NFLX | 30.0% | 118 purchases | $3.08M+ |
| GOOGL | 16.9% | 177 purchases | $2.72M+ |
| MSFT | 12.7% | 187 purchases | $11.27M+ |

### How to Use

1. Visit [Quiver Quantitative](https://www.quiverquant.com/congresstrading/)
2. Filter by recency, politician, or stock
3. Look for clusters of buying activity
4. Consider as one input among many (not sole strategy)

### Ethical Considerations

- Legal for retail investors to follow
- Politicians themselves face restrictions
- Disclosure delay (up to 45 days) means trades are backward-looking
- Works best as supplementary signal, not primary strategy

### CD Laddering

**Current Best Rates (Jan 2026):**
| Term | Best Rate | Provider |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 3-month | 4.18% | Citibank |
| 6-month | 4.15% | Northern Bank Direct |
| 12-month | 4.10% | Synchrony |

**Strategy:**
1. Split savings into 4-5 equal portions
2. Buy CDs with staggered maturities (3mo, 6mo, 9mo, 12mo, 18mo)
3. As each matures, reinvest at longest term
4. Creates regular liquidity while earning higher rates

**Tip:** Pair with high-yield savings (4.35% at Newtek Bank) for funds awaiting reinvestment.

**Source:** [Bankrate CD Rates](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/cds/cd-rates/)

---

### Tax-Loss Harvesting

**What It Is:** Sell losing positions to offset capital gains elsewhere.

**Potential Benefit:** Add 1-2% to after-tax returns annually

**Best Practices:**
1. Don't wait until December - harvest year-round
2. Avoid wash-sale rule (30-day wait or buy similar, not identical ETF)
3. Only works in taxable accounts (not IRAs/401k)
4. Use automation (Wealthfront, Betterment) for best results

**ETF Swap Example:**
- Sell VTI at loss
- Immediately buy ITOT (similar but not "substantially identical")
- Maintain market exposure while capturing tax loss

**Source:** [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/taxes/offset-gains-loss-harvesting), [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/tax-loss-harvesting)

---

### Direct Indexing

**What It Is:** Own individual stocks that replicate an index, instead of buying the fund.

**Benefit:** More tax-loss harvesting opportunities (can sell individual losers even when index is up)

**Potential Return Boost:** 0.3-1.0% annually in after-tax returns

**Minimums:**
- Schwab Personalized Indexing: $100,000
- Wealthfront: $100,000+

**Best For:** High tax bracket investors with $100k+ in taxable accounts

**Source:** [Charles Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/tax-advantages-and-risks-direct-indexing)

---

### REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)

**Why Consider:** Diversification, income, inflation hedge

**Best Low-Cost REIT ETFs:**
| ETF | Expense Ratio | Assets | Yield |
|-----|---------------|--------|-------|
| SCHH | 0.07% | $6B | ~3.5% |
| VNQ | 0.12% | $33B | ~3.8% |

**Suggested Allocation:**
- 30-40%: Industrial & Data Center REITs (growth)
- 25-35%: Healthcare & Residential (defensive)
- 20-30%: Retail & Specialty (income)

**Tax Tip:** Hold REITs in tax-advantaged accounts (Roth IRA) due to dividend taxation.

- Expense Ratio: 0.35%
- Yield: ~2.55%
- 2025 Return: 7.2% (underperformed S&P's 18.4%)

**Better Alternative:** SCHD (Schwab US Dividend Equity)

- Higher yield
- Morningstar Silver rating

**Best For:** Income-focused investors willing to accept lower growth for stability.

## Part 5: Farm-Specific Financial Strategies

### USDA Farm Loan Programs

| Loan Type | Max Amount | Rate (2025) | Best For |
|-----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| Direct Farm Ownership | $600,000 | 4.5-5.0% | Land purchase, buildings |
| Direct Operating | $400,000 | 4.25-4.75% | Seeds, equipment, livestock |
| Microloans | $50,000 | 3.75%+ | Small/beginning farmers |
| Guaranteed Loans | $2.3M | Market rates | Larger operations |

**Beginning Farmer Focus:** FSA sets aside funds specifically for farmers in their first 10 years.

**Conservation Loans:** Lower rates for sustainable practices, renewable energy, water conservation.

**Source:** [USDA FSA](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/resources/farm-loan-programs), [Farmers.gov](https://www.farmers.gov/loans)

---

### Farm Credit System vs USDA

| Factor | USDA FSA | Farm Credit System |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Rates | 3.75-5.0% | 6.0-7.25% |
| Processing | Slower | Faster |
| Requirements | Stricter | More flexible |
| Loan Size | Up to $600k direct | Larger available |

**Recommendation:** Try USDA first for lower rates; Farm Credit for speed or larger amounts.

---

### Weather Derivatives

**What They Are:** Financial contracts that pay based on weather conditions (not crop damage).

**How They Work:**
- Set threshold (e.g., rainfall below 2 inches)
- If threshold met, automatic payout
- No need to prove damage

**Advantages Over Crop Insurance:**
- Faster payout
- No loss adjustment
- Can cover revenue loss from bad weather

**Challenges for Small Farms:**
- "Basis risk" - weather at measuring station may differ from your farm
- Complex pricing
- Currently more accessible for larger operations

**Future Potential:** Government could use weather derivatives to reduce crop insurance program costs.

---

### Seasonal Cash Flow Management

**Emergency Fund Sizing:**
- Minimum: 3-6 months operating expenses
- Recommended: 20-30% of annual expenses
- Reserve during harvest: 15-20% of revenue

**Income Smoothing Strategies:**
1. **Schedule J**: Average farm income over 3 years for tax purposes
2. **Operating loans**: Time repayment to post-harvest
3. **Negotiate supplier terms**: Longer payment periods before planting
4. **Diversify income**: Off-season activities, equipment rental

**Cash Flow Budget Must Include:**
- All income sources (crops, livestock, CSA, government payments)
- All expenses (seeds, labor, equipment, loan payments)
- Seasonal timing of both

Starting 2026, OBBBA imposes:

- Federal crop insurance (FCIC)
- Multi-peril crop insurance
- Whole-farm revenue protection
