## QUESTIONS FOR PM / OWNER

### Strategic Decisions Needed:

1. **Investment Brokerage**
   - Should we integrate Alpaca for automated trading?
   - Or use Composer (no-code) for strategy execution?
   - Or manual execution based on signals?

2. **Cash Management Platform**
   - Meow requires $100k minimum - is this feasible?
   - Mercury requires $250k for Treasury - alternative?
   - Wealthfront Bond Ladder at $500 minimum?

3. **QuickBooks/Shopify Integration**
   - Still priority? (Owner previously requested)
   - Should we implement OAuth2 flows?
   - Or focus on investment infrastructure first?

4. **Plaid Production Mode**
   - Ready to switch from sandbox to production?
   - Are credentials configured in Script Properties?

5. **Budget Allocation**
   - What's the initial investment capital?
   - Monthly contribution amount?
   - Risk tolerance level?

### Rabbit Holes Explored

**Congressional Trading (Deep Dive):**
- Quiver Quantitative's "Congress Buys" strategy: 35.4% CAGR
- Top buys: NFLX (30%), GOOGL (17%), MSFT (13%)
- 45-day disclosure delay is main limitation
- Legal and practical for retail investors

**Weather Derivatives (Interesting but Limited):**
- Financial contracts pay on weather, not crop damage
- Faster than crop insurance, no loss adjustment needed
- "Basis risk" makes it challenging for small farms
- More feasible for large operations currently
