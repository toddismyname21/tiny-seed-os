### Rabbit Holes Explored

**Congressional Trading (Deep Dive):**
- Quiver Quantitative's "Congress Buys" strategy: 35.4% CAGR
- Top buys: NFLX (30%), GOOGL (17%), MSFT (13%)
- 45-day disclosure delay is main limitation
- Legal and practical for retail investors

**Weather Derivatives (Interesting but Limited):**
- Financial contracts pay on weather, not crop damage
- Faster than crop insurance, no loss adjustment needed
- "Basis risk" makes it challenging for small farms
- More feasible for large operations currently
