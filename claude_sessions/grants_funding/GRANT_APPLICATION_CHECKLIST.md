2. Are you comfortable with high tunnel installation location?
3. Would you provide a letter of support for the grant application?

## APPLICATION STRENGTHS TO EMPHASIZE

## POTENTIAL CHALLENGES TO ADDRESS

### Land Control
**Issue:** No signed lease with Don Kretschmann
**Mitigation:** Get letter of land use authorization; emphasize farmland trust plans

### Financial Performance
**Issue:** 2025 was transitional year with losses
**Mitigation:** Focus on 2026 revenue target ($500K); emphasize expansion trajectory
