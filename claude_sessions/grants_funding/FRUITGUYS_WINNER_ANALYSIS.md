## THE FARMING MANIFESTO - KEY ALIGNMENT AREAS

FruitGuys explicitly asks applicants to review their Farming Manifesto. Here's how winning projects align:

| Manifesto Area | Winning Project Examples |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| **Soil** | Compost systems, cover crops, soil blockers |
| **Water** | Drip irrigation, rainwater catchment |
| **Biodiversity** | Hedgerows, wildlife habitat, native plants |
| **Pollination** | Beehives, flowering plants |
| **Climate** | Solar power, season extension, drought resilience |
| **Waste** | Compost, eliminating plastic, closed-loop systems |
| **Certifications** | Organic certification support |
| **Equity** | Food access, underrepresented farmers |

---

## TINY SEED FARM: STRATEGIC FIT ANALYSIS

### Strengths for Application
| Strength | How It Helps |
|----------|--------------|
| Beginning Farmer status | 75%+ of winners are beginning farmers |
| Certified Organic (OEFFA) | Aligns with Manifesto certifications |
| Small acreage | 85%+ of winners are under 50 acres |
| Food access mission | Aligns with equity/community focus |
| Vegetable + Flower production | Specialty crops = pollinator connection |

### Potential Concerns
| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
