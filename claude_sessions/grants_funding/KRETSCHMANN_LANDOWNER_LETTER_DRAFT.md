RE: Landowner Support Letter for Tiny Seed Farm Grant Application

Dear FruitGuys Community Fund,

I am writing to express my full support for Todd Wilson and Tiny Seed Farm's application to the FruitGuys Community Fund for their water-efficient irrigation project.

## About Our Farm's History

My family established Kretschmann Farm in **[YEAR]** as **Western Pennsylvania's first certified organic farm**. For over **[NUMBER]** years, we have been committed to sustainable agriculture, building healthy soil, and providing our community with nutritious, organically-grown food. Our farm helped prove that organic agriculture was viable in this region when few believed it possible.

## Our Relationship with Tiny Seed Farm

Todd Wilson and Tiny Seed Farm have been farming on our property since **[YEAR]**. Our current lease arrangement is **[DESCRIBE: e.g., "a year-to-year agreement" or "a 3-year lease through 2028"]**.

**It is our intention to continue this partnership for the long term.** Todd shares our commitment to organic agriculture and sustainable practices, and we are pleased to see our family's farming legacy continue under his stewardship. We view this as a multi-generational relationship, not a temporary arrangement.

## Support for This Project

I fully approve the proposed irrigation improvement project on our property. This project includes:

- Installation of water-efficient Sumisansui irrigation tubes
- FarmHQ cellular remote control system
- Zone valves and related infrastructure

These improvements align perfectly with our farm's decades-long commitment to environmental stewardship. Reducing water usage by 40% while improving crop quality honors the sustainable farming principles we established here in Western Pennsylvania.

The infrastructure Todd proposes to install will benefit this land for many seasons to come, and I am confident he will complete the project successfully. As someone with **[NUMBER]** years of irrigation experience on this property, I am available to provide guidance if needed.

## Our Legacy

When we began organic farming in Western Pennsylvania, we were pioneers in a region dominated by conventional agriculture. It brings us great satisfaction to see a new generation of farmers continuing this work. Todd's commitment to organic certification, sustainable practices, and serving the Pittsburgh community through his CSA program represents exactly the kind of farming we hoped to inspire.

We wholeheartedly support this grant application and believe Tiny Seed Farm is an excellent candidate for FruitGuys Community Fund support.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

**[SIGNATURE]**

## NOTES FOR DON:

1. **The "short-term lease" issue**: The FruitGuys application shows "Short-term Lease (less than 3 years)" which could be a concern. Your letter addresses this by emphasizing:
   - Intent to continue long-term
   - Multi-generational relationship
   - Not a temporary arrangement

2. **The legacy angle**: Your family's history as Western PA's first organic farm is a MAJOR strength of this application. It transforms Todd from "just another tenant farmer" into "the steward of historic organic farmland."

3. **Project approval**: Grant funders want to know the landowner supports permanent improvements. Your explicit approval of the irrigation infrastructure reassures them.

4. **Backup support**: Mentioning your willingness to provide guidance shows the project has experienced backup if needed.
