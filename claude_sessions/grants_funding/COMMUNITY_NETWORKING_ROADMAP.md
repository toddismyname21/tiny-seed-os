- Help other farmers when you can
- Participate in community events

### Follow Up
- After meeting someone, send a brief email
- Connect on social media if appropriate
- Invite them to visit your farm
- Remember details about their operation

### Be Authentic
- You don't have to know everything
- Asking questions builds relationships
- Share your challenges, not just successes
- People connect with genuine farmers

### Think Long-Term
- These relationships compound over years
- Today's acquaintance is tomorrow's grant partner
- Your reputation matters
- The farming community is small - be someone people want to work with

## THE KRETSCHMANN CONNECTION

**Don't underestimate this asset.**

The Kretschmanns are pioneers - first organic farm in Western PA. Their network includes:
- Decades of Extension relationships
- Connections to early organic movement
- Knowledge of who's who in regional agriculture

**Ask Don:**
- Who should I meet in the farming community?
- Are there networks or organizations you'd recommend?
- Would you introduce me to your Extension contacts?

This single conversation could open more doors than months of cold outreach.
