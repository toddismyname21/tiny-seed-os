## SESSION 3 UPDATE (2026-01-16)

**Document Review:** Attempted to extract additional data from owner_uploads documents.

**Finding:** Several FSA/USDA documents in owner_uploads are password-protected PDFs - cannot extract Farm Number or other federal registration details without passwords.

**Grant Readiness Status:** Core documents already well-populated from Session 2. The remaining gaps require Todd to:
1. Provide SAM.gov login to verify expiration date
2. Call FSA to get Farm Number (or provide PDF passwords)
3. Provide 3-year revenue figures from bookkeeper
4. Document previous grant application outcomes

**No blocking issues** - existing data is sufficient to begin EQIP consultation and PA Ag Innovation prep.

## RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (This Week)

### For Todd/Owner

| Priority | Action | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **#1** | Call NRCS to schedule consultation | 90% cost-share opportunity |
| **#2** | Verify SAM.gov registration is current | Blocks all federal grants if expired |
| **#3** | Get simple letter from Don confirming land use | EQIP requires proof of land control |
| **#4** | Review FruitGuys deadline (Jan 30) | Easy $5K if applicable |

### For Owner (Data Needed)
Still need answers to populate remaining gaps:
1. SAM.gov expiration date
2. USDA Farm Number (call FSA)
3. 2023-2025 revenue figures
4. Vegetable vs. flower acreage breakdown
5. Outcomes of previous grant applications

---

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY: THE LEASE PROBLEM

**Issue:** Multiple federal grants (EQIP, VAPG) require proof of "control" over the land. Todd has no signed lease.

**Impact:**
- May block EQIP application
- Creates risk for any infrastructure investment
- Mentioned in multiple business docs as concern

**Mitigation Options:**
1. Get Don to sign simple lease (ideal)
2. Get signed letter confirming permission to farm
3. Ask NRCS what minimum documentation they'll accept

**Suggested language for Don:**
> "Don, I'm exploring NRCS conservation funding that could cover 90% of infrastructure costs. They need documentation that I have permission to farm here. Would you be willing to sign a simple letter? It doesn't commit you to anything specific - just verifies I'm authorized to be here."

---

## GRANT STRATEGY SUMMARY

### Priority 1: EQIP (Federal - NRCS)
- **Why:** 90% cost-share for beginning farmers
- **Potential:** $10,000 - $50,000 in infrastructure
- **Todd's Cost:** Only 10% of project
- **Action:** Call NRCS THIS WEEK

### Priority 2: PA Ag Innovation (State)
- **Why:** Opens Feb 2, Todd has applied before
- **Potential:** $5,000 - $200,000
- **Match:** 50% required (can use owned tunnels?)
- **Action:** Download guidelines Jan 24, start application Feb 2

### Priority 3: SCBGP (Federal - Specialty Crops)
- **Why:** Vegetables AND flowers qualify
- **Potential:** From $1M state pool
- **Action:** Watch for 2026 cycle announcement

## BEGINNING FARMER ADVANTAGE

Todd's Beginning Farmer status is GOLD:

| Program | Standard Rate | Beginning Farmer Rate |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| EQIP | 75% cost-share | **90% cost-share** |
| EQIP | Payment after completion | **50% advance payment** |
| VAPG | Regular scoring | **Priority scoring** |
| FSA Loans | Standard terms | **Enhanced terms** |

**This status will expire** when Todd reaches 10 years farming experience. Use it now!

---

## QUESTIONS FOR OTHER CLAUDES

### For Business_Foundation Claude:
- What's the status of the lease negotiation with Don?
- Can we get a simple letter of land use authorization?
- Is there a farmland trust timeline?

### For Financial Claude:
- Can you provide 2023-2025 revenue figures for grant applications?
- What's the current cash position for grant match funds?
- Is equipment owned by Todd documented with values?

### For PM_Architect:
- Should we prioritize getting Don's signature on something?
- Is there a central document tracking owner action items?

---

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. **Review PA Ag Innovation official guidelines** (published Jan 24) - compare to draft
2. **Confirm Todd got letter from Don** - critical blocker
3. **Update draft with official application format** - adapt to portal requirements
4. Follow up on whether NRCS consultation is scheduled
5. Research VAPG fit (value-added products?)
6. Check for any new grant announcements

---

## BLOCKERS

| Blocker | Impact | Owner Action Needed |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| No signed lease | May block EQIP | Get letter from Don |
| SAM.gov unknown status | Blocks federal apps | Verify expiration |
| Missing Farm Number | Blocks some programs | Call FSA |
| No revenue data | Weakens applications | Provide 3-year figures |

*Grants_Funding Claude - Ready for continued work. Recommend scheduling NRCS call as top priority.*
