## STATUS: ACTIVE - Grant Readiness System Populated

---

## SESSION 3 UPDATE (2026-01-16)

**Document Review:** Attempted to extract additional data from owner_uploads documents.

**Finding:** Several FSA/USDA documents in owner_uploads are password-protected PDFs - cannot extract Farm Number or other federal registration details without passwords.

**Grant Readiness Status:** Core documents already well-populated from Session 2. The remaining gaps require Todd to:
1. Provide SAM.gov login to verify expiration date
2. Call FSA to get Farm Number (or provide PDF passwords)
3. Provide 3-year revenue figures from bookkeeper
4. Document previous grant application outcomes

**No blocking issues** - existing data is sufficient to begin EQIP consultation and PA Ag Innovation prep.

## RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (This Week)

### For Todd/Owner

| Priority | Action | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **#1** | Call NRCS to schedule consultation | 90% cost-share opportunity |
| **#2** | Verify SAM.gov registration is current | Blocks all federal grants if expired |
| **#3** | Get simple letter from Don confirming land use | EQIP requires proof of land control |
| **#4** | Review FruitGuys deadline (Jan 30) | Easy $5K if applicable |

### For Owner (Data Needed)
Still need answers to populate remaining gaps:
1. SAM.gov expiration date
2. USDA Farm Number (call FSA)
3. 2023-2025 revenue figures
4. Vegetable vs. flower acreage breakdown
5. Outcomes of previous grant applications

---

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY: THE LEASE PROBLEM

**Issue:** Multiple federal grants (EQIP, VAPG) require proof of "control" over the land. Todd has no signed lease.

**Impact:**
- May block EQIP application
- Creates risk for any infrastructure investment
- Mentioned in multiple business docs as concern

**Mitigation Options:**
1. Get Don to sign simple lease (ideal)
2. Get signed letter confirming permission to farm
3. Ask NRCS what minimum documentation they'll accept

**Suggested language for Don:**
> "Don, I'm exploring NRCS conservation funding that could cover 90% of infrastructure costs. They need documentation that I have permission to farm here. Would you be willing to sign a simple letter? It doesn't commit you to anything specific - just verifies I'm authorized to be here."

## GRANT STRATEGY SUMMARY

### Priority 1: EQIP (Federal - NRCS)
- **Why:** 90% cost-share for beginning farmers
- **Potential:** $10,000 - $50,000 in infrastructure
- **Todd's Cost:** Only 10% of project
- **Action:** Call NRCS THIS WEEK

### Priority 2: PA Ag Innovation (State)
- **Why:** Opens Feb 2, Todd has applied before
- **Potential:** $5,000 - $200,000
- **Match:** 50% required (can use owned tunnels?)
- **Action:** Download guidelines Jan 24, start application Feb 2

### Priority 3: SCBGP (Federal - Specialty Crops)
- **Why:** Vegetables AND flowers qualify
- **Potential:** From $1M state pool
- **Action:** Watch for 2026 cycle announcement

## BEGINNING FARMER ADVANTAGE

Todd's Beginning Farmer status is GOLD:

| Program | Standard Rate | Beginning Farmer Rate |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| EQIP | 75% cost-share | **90% cost-share** |
| EQIP | Payment after completion | **50% advance payment** |
| VAPG | Regular scoring | **Priority scoring** |
| FSA Loans | Standard terms | **Enhanced terms** |

## QUESTIONS FOR OTHER CLAUDES

### For Business_Foundation Claude:
- What's the status of the lease negotiation with Don?
- Can we get a simple letter of land use authorization?
- Is there a farmland trust timeline?

### For Financial Claude:
- Can you provide 2023-2025 revenue figures for grant applications?
- What's the current cash position for grant match funds?
- Is equipment owned by Todd documented with values?

### For PM_Architect:
- Should we prioritize getting Don's signature on something?
- Is there a central document tracking owner action items?

---

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. Follow up on whether NRCS consultation is scheduled
2. Check if guidelines published Jan 24 (PA Ag Innovation)
3. Begin drafting PA Ag Innovation application
4. Research VAPG fit (value-added products?)
5. Check for any new grant announcements

---

## BLOCKERS

| Blocker | Impact | Owner Action Needed |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| No signed lease | May block EQIP | Get letter from Don |
| SAM.gov unknown status | Blocks federal apps | Verify expiration |
| Missing Farm Number | Blocks some programs | Call FSA |
| No revenue data | Weakens applications | Provide 3-year figures |

*Grants_Funding Claude - Ready for continued work. Recommend scheduling NRCS call as top priority.*
