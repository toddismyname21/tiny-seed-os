## NE SARE RESEARCH & EDUCATION GRANT: NOT THIS CYCLE

**Deadline:** February 2, 2026
**Amount:** $30,000 - $250,000
**Verdict:** Skip this cycle, target 2027

### Why Not Now
- 10 days is not enough time for a $50K+ collaborative grant
- Requires partner organizations (Penn State, PASA, etc.)
- Needs advisory committee already formed
- Designed for educational programs, not individual farm improvements

### Long-Term Strategy Created
Instead of rushing a weak application, we created a **Community Networking Roadmap** to:
- Build relationships with Extension, PASA, other farmers
- Position Tiny Seed as a demonstration site
- Apply for smaller **NE SARE Farmer Grant** ($5K-$30K) in 2026
- Submit strong R&E application in 2027 with established partnerships

## NEW FILE: COMMUNITY NETWORKING ROADMAP

| Ask Don for introductions | Kretschmann | 40+ years of relationships |
