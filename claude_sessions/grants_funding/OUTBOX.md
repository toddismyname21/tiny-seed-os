## CRITICAL QUESTION: CAN ROUND 1 RECIPIENTS APPLY FOR ROUND 2?

### Context: TINY SEED FARM RECEIVED A ROUND 1 GRANT

This is not about "applicants" - the farm actually **received funding** in Round 1.

### Research Result: **NO EXPLICIT ANSWER IN GUIDELINES**

I searched ALL official sources:
- PA.gov application page
- Pennsylvania Bulletin Vol 54-39 (original guidelines)
- Pennsylvania Bulletin Vol 55-20 (updates)
- 2026 Farm Show Round 2 announcement
- PASA info session materials
- Penn State Extension resources

**Finding:** The published guidelines contain **ZERO language** about:
- Prohibiting previous recipients from reapplying
- Explicitly allowing repeat applications
- Any restrictions based on prior awards
- Multiple awards to same entity
- Round 1 awardees applying for Round 2

### WHAT THIS MEANS

**Good news:** No explicit prohibition found
**Bad news:** No explicit permission either
**Risk:** If prohibited, we waste significant prep time

### ACTION: TODD CALLING MICHAEL ROTH TOMORROW (Jan 23)

```
Contact: Michael Roth
Phone:   717-210-1217
Email:   michroth@pa.gov

QUESTION TO ASK:
"Tiny Seed Farm received a PA Agricultural Innovation
Grant in Round 1. Are we eligible to apply for Round 2
with a DIFFERENT project?"
```

**Status:** WAITING FOR ANSWER
**Guidelines publish:** Jan 24 (may also clarify this)

**If YES:** Continue with $62,500 draft application
**If NO:** Redirect to EQIP, SARE, Clif Bar, Heinz Endowments
