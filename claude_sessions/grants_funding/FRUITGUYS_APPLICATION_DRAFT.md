### Please describe the context of your farming practices within your community?

```
Tiny Seed Farm operates on land pioneered by the Kretschmann family—the very first certified organic growers in Western Pennsylvania. We are honored to steward this historically significant farmland and are committed to continuing their legacy of organic agriculture for decades to come.

In Beaver County, a rural area largely dominated by conventional agriculture, we represent the continuation of a regional organic farming tradition that began with the Kretschmanns. As one of the few certified organic diversified vegetable farms in the county, we provide an alternative model for sustainable agriculture while honoring the pioneers who proved organic farming was viable in Western PA.

Our farm bridges rural production and urban consumers, delivering certified organic produce to Pittsburgh neighborhoods with limited access to locally-grown organic food. We're located in an economically distressed area (verified via DCI map), making our contribution to local food access particularly meaningful. We actively participate in regional farming networks and mentor beginning farmers interested in organic production—passing forward what the Kretschmanns' legacy taught us about sustainable agriculture.
```

---

### Tell us about any other farming practices of your farm. (150 words)

```
Beyond organic certification, we implement regenerative practices including cover cropping with diverse mixes (crimson clover, winter rye, field peas) to build soil organic matter and prevent erosion. We practice minimal tillage where possible, use compost from local sources, and maintain habitat areas for beneficial insects and pollinators.

Our crop rotation follows a 4-year cycle to break pest and disease cycles naturally. We use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) including beneficial insect releases, row covers, and habitat strips for natural predators rather than relying solely on organic-approved sprays.

We're committed to reducing waste—our CSA operates on a returnable container system. Water conservation is our next priority: this grant application focuses on upgrading to highly efficient Japanese-designed irrigation technology combined with cellular remote control, which will reduce water usage by 40% while eliminating daily trips to manually operate our pump across our 80-acre property.

### Project Description Narrative (500 words)

```
Tiny Seed Farm operates on land pioneered by the Kretschmann family—the first certified organic growers in Western Pennsylvania. As a beginning farmer honored to continue their decades-long legacy, I'm committed to building infrastructure worthy of this historic farmland.

Our challenge is water—and labor. Our 80-acre Beaver County property is water-insecure, and our current irrigation system wastes both water and time. An electric pump draws from an on-site pond, connected to a basic timer with no zone control and no remote access. Every irrigation decision requires a physical trip across hilly terrain to the pump—often multiple times daily during peak growing season.

This inefficiency costs us an estimated 3+ hours daily in irrigation management: driving to the pump, adjusting timers, checking conditions, returning to turn things off. That's over 500 hours per season—time a beginning farmer desperately needs for production, marketing, and building a sustainable business. We're also wasting an estimated 40% of our irrigation water through uniform watering across diverse crop zones.

Our Solution: We propose to install a Sumisansui R-Wide water-efficient irrigation system combined with FarmHQ cellular remote control technology.

The Sumisansui R-Wide is a Japanese-designed micro-perforated irrigation system delivering gentle, uniform water distribution with documented 40% water savings. Its 32-foot spray width covers more area with fewer tubes, and the reusable, UV-resistant construction lasts 5+ seasons.

The system includes:
- Three 430-foot field zones for vegetables, secondary crops, and cut flowers
- One 100-foot portable greenhouse zone for seedlings and season extension
- Four winders for efficient tube deployment, retrieval, and storage
- Pressure regulation to protect the system from our higher-PSI pump

FarmHQ provides cellular-based remote control purpose-built for farms. With powerful external antennas and connections to hundreds of cellular carriers, it works reliably even in remote rural areas. From my phone, I can:
- Turn the pump on/off from anywhere—no more trips across the property
- Control zone valves to water specific areas as needed
- Set automated schedules that run without intervention
- Receive alerts if something goes wrong
- Adjust watering in response to weather, even when I'm at farmers market

This transforms irrigation from a daily physical burden into efficient oversight. The labor savings are real and significant: from 3+ hours daily to minutes of phone-based management.

Water Conservation Impact: The Sumisansui system's rectangular spray pattern eliminates overlap waste, while zone control ensures each crop receives appropriate irrigation. Combined, we expect 40% water reduction—approximately 50,000 gallons saved per growing season.

Labor Impact: Remote cellular access eliminates daily trips across our 80-acre property. We project saving 500+ labor hours annually, freeing time for crop production, community engagement, and building a sustainable farm business.

Legacy Impact: The Kretschmanns built Western PA's organic farming foundation. We're building on it with modern, efficient systems that honor their environmental ethic while preparing this historic farmland for the next generation of sustainable agriculture.

Total project cost is $5,198. We are requesting $5,000 from FruitGuys Community Fund, with Tiny Seed Farm contributing $198 to complete the project.

### Do you foresee any challenges to completing the project by December?

```
No significant challenges anticipated. The Sumisansui system is designed for farmer self-installation without specialized contractors—tubes deploy from winders and connect to standard fittings. FarmHQ is specifically designed for farm installation with straightforward setup and excellent customer support included in the service subscription.

We have verified cellular coverage at our pump location, ensuring reliable FarmHQ connectivity. All components integrate with our existing 2" layflat water distribution infrastructure, minimizing complexity.

The only minor consideration is coordinating installation around peak growing season activities in June-July, but the immediate labor savings from remote pump control will quickly offset installation time. As the farm owner with hands-on irrigation experience, I'm confident in completing installation within the timeline.

## COMMUNITY IMPACT

### Continuing the Kretschmann Legacy

Tiny Seed Farm operates on land that made history—the Kretschmann family established Western Pennsylvania's first certified organic farm on this property. We are honored to continue their pioneering work and committed to stewarding this land for decades to come.

This grant helps us build infrastructure worthy of that legacy: modern, efficient, environmentally responsible systems that honor the Kretschmanns' vision while preparing the farm for the next generation.

### Local Food Access

We serve CSA member families throughout the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, providing weekly shares of certified organic vegetables and flowers. Improved irrigation efficiency will:

- **Increase crop yields** by reducing water-stress losses (currently 10-15%)
- **Improve crop quality** through consistent moisture management
- **Strengthen food security** for Pittsburgh families who depend on our weekly shares
- **Expand capacity** as labor savings allow us to grow more

### Educational Multiplier Effect

We will document and share our results:
- Detailed water savings data published to regional farm networks
- Installation guide shared with Beaver County farming community
- Presentation at PASA (Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture) events
- Case study for beginning farmers considering efficient irrigation

If just 5 neighboring farms adopt similar technology based on our documented success, regional water savings could exceed **200,000 gallons annually**.

### Regional Water Stewardship

Western Pennsylvania faces increasing water management challenges as climate patterns shift. By reducing our irrigation water consumption by **40% (approximately 50,000 gallons per season)**, we contribute to regional water security while modeling sustainable practices.
