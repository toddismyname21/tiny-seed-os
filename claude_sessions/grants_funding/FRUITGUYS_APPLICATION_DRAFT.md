## PROJECT NARRATIVE

### Current Situation

Tiny Seed Farm operates in a **water-insecure environment** in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. Our current irrigation system relies on an electric pump drawing from an on-site pond, connected to a basic timer that runs on a fixed schedule regardless of actual crop needs or weather conditions.

This inefficient approach results in:
- **Water waste** from uniform watering across diverse crop zones
- **Overwatering** of some areas while underwatering others
- **No ability to respond** to weather changes or varying crop needs
- **Labor inefficiency** requiring physical trips to manually turn pump on/off
- **Inflexible scheduling** - pump runs on timer regardless of actual conditions
- **Crop stress** from inconsistent moisture levels

As a certified organic farm serving CSA members throughout the Pittsburgh region, water efficiency directly impacts our ability to produce healthy crops while stewarding our limited water resources responsibly.

### Proposed Solution

We propose to upgrade our irrigation infrastructure with a **Sumisansui Mark III water-efficient irrigation system** combined with a **WiFi-enabled smart controller** capable of independent zone management.

**The Sumisansui R-Wide** is a Japanese-designed micro-perforated irrigation system that delivers uniform water distribution across an impressive **22-32 foot spray width**. Independent trials in Japan and Spain have documented **40% water savings** compared to conventional sprinkler systems while improving crop uniformity.

**Key benefits:**
- **32-foot spray width** - covers more area with fewer tubes
- Rectangular spray pattern eliminates overlap waste
- Operating pressure 15-30 PSI matches our existing pump capacity
- Reusable, UV-resistant construction lasts multiple seasons
- Wide coverage ideal for established field crops and flowers

**The Rain Bird ST8O-2.0 Smart Controller + Pump Start Relay** will enable:
- **Remote pump control** - turn pump on/off from smartphone, eliminating manual trips
- **3 independent irrigation zones** tailored to crop needs (expandable to 8)
- **WiFi access from anywhere** - monitor and control irrigation remotely
- **Automatic succession watering** - zones run one after another without intervention
- **Weather-based adjustments** - skips watering when rain is detected
- **Scheduling flexibility** - water at optimal times (early morning) automatically

### Project Scope

We will install a **4-zone smart irrigation system** covering our primary vegetable and flower production areas (300-400 ft field sections) plus a portable greenhouse system, integrating with our existing 2" layflat water distribution infrastructure:

| Zone | Location | Length | Crop Focus |
|------|----------|--------|------------|
| Zone 1 | Main vegetable field | 430 ft | Leafy greens, brassicas |
| Zone 2 | Secondary production | 430 ft | Fruiting crops, roots |
| Zone 3 | Cut flower field | 430 ft | Annual & perennial flowers |
| Zone 4 | Greenhouse (portable) | 100 ft | Seedlings, transplants, season extension |

**Total Coverage:** ~1,390 linear feet of precision irrigation

**Winder System:** Each zone includes a dedicated winder for efficient tube deployment, retrieval, and storage. The portable greenhouse winder allows the 100' tube to be easily moved between greenhouse structures as crop rotations require.

### Alignment with FruitGuys Farming Manifesto

This project directly advances multiple Farming Manifesto practice areas:

**WATER (Priority #2):**
> "Employ efficient watering systems for a given crop and soil type"

The Sumisansui system's documented 40% water reduction directly addresses this priority. Zone-based control ensures each crop receives appropriate irrigation rather than one-size-fits-all watering.

**CLIMATE (Priority #7):**
> "Adopt climate-adaptive practices... improve energy efficiency"

Smart scheduling reduces pump run time and energy consumption. Weather integration prevents irrigation during rain events. Water conservation builds resilience against increasing drought conditions in our region.

**SOIL (Priority #1):**
> "Control erosion"

Gentle, uniform water application prevents soil erosion and compaction compared to high-pressure sprinklers. Consistent moisture supports healthy soil biology.

**BUSINESS (Priority #11):**
> "Implement tools and systems to track all business details"

Digital monitoring provides data on water usage by zone, enabling continuous improvement and documentation of our conservation practices.

### Expected Outcomes

| Metric | Current | Expected | Improvement |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Water usage | Baseline | 40% reduction | Documented savings |
| Labor (irrigation mgmt) | 3+ hrs/day | <1 hr/day | 66% reduction |
| Crop uniformity | Variable | Consistent | Improved yields |
| Weather responsiveness | None | Automatic | Reduced waste |
| Zone customization | 1 zone | 6 zones | 500% increase |

### Timeline

| Date | Milestone |

| May 2026 | Award notification; order equipment |
| June 2026 | Receive and install irrigation tubes |
| June 2026 | Install smart controller and zone valves |
| July 2026 | System testing and calibration |
| August 2026 | Interim report with initial results |
| Sept-Nov 2026 | Full season operation and data collection |
| December 2026 | Project completion |

## COMMUNITY IMPACT

### Local Food Access

Tiny Seed Farm serves **[X] CSA member households** throughout the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, providing weekly shares of certified organic vegetables and flowers. Improved irrigation efficiency will:

- **Increase crop yields** available for community distribution
- **Improve crop quality** through consistent moisture management
- **Extend growing season** with better transplant establishment
- **Reduce crop losses** from drought stress or overwatering

### Educational Value

As a farm committed to sustainable practices, we regularly host:
- Farm tours for community members
- Educational visits from local schools
- Beginning farmer mentorship

This project will demonstrate water-efficient irrigation technology that other small farms in our region can adopt, multiplying the conservation impact beyond our own operation.

### Regional Water Stewardship

Beaver County, Pennsylvania faces increasing water management challenges. By reducing our irrigation water consumption by an estimated 40%, we contribute to regional water security while modeling sustainable practices for neighboring farms.

---

## SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENT

### Existing Sustainable Practices

Tiny Seed Farm already demonstrates commitment to the Farming Manifesto through:

- **USDA Organic Certification** (OEFFA #3839) - No synthetic pesticides or fertilizers
- **Cover Cropping** - Building soil health and preventing erosion
- **Crop Diversity** - Growing 30+ vegetable varieties plus cut flowers
- **Local Distribution** - CSA model minimizes food miles
- **Beginning Farmer** - Contributing to the next generation of sustainable agriculture

### Long-Term Vision

This irrigation upgrade is part of our broader farm infrastructure development to:
- Reduce environmental footprint
- Increase climate resilience
- Improve economic sustainability
- Expand community food access

The reusable Sumisansui system and durable smart controller represent long-term investments that will serve our farm for many seasons, compounding the environmental benefits year after year.
