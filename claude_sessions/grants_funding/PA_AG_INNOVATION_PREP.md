## MATCH FUNDING SOURCES

**The 50% match must come from non-state sources:**

### Potential Match Sources for Tiny Seed
1. **Owner contribution** (cash or in-kind)
2. **Equipment Todd already owns** (tunnels worth $15,000-30,000)
3. **Bank loan** (counts as match if non-state)
4. **Federal grants** (EQIP could potentially stack - verify!)
5. **Labor contribution** (valued at reasonable rate)
6. **In-kind donations** from partners

### The Tunnel Advantage
Todd owns high tunnels and caterpillar tunnels worth approximately $15,000-30,000. These could potentially count as match contribution if the project involves their installation.

**Question to ask PDA:** Can previously purchased equipment count toward match if being installed as part of the project?
