# EQIP Consultation Prep
## Tiny Seed Farm - Talking Points for NRCS Meeting

**Purpose:** Prepare Todd for initial NRCS consultation to explore EQIP funding
**Priority:** HIGH - 90% cost-share available as Beginning Farmer
**Action:** Call local NRCS office to schedule appointment

---

## WHY EQIP IS THE #1 PRIORITY

### The Beginning Farmer Advantage
- **Standard cost-share:** 75% of project costs
- **Beginning Farmer cost-share:** UP TO 90% of project costs
- **Advance payment:** 50% of payment available UPFRONT for beginning farmers
- **Todd qualifies:** Less than 10 years farming experience = Beginning Farmer

### What This Means in Dollars
| Project | Estimated Cost | Standard (75%) | Beginning Farmer (90%) | Todd Pays |
|---------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------|
| High Tunnel (30x96) | $10,000 | $7,500 | $9,000 | **$1,000** |
| Irrigation System | $15,000 | $11,250 | $13,500 | **$1,500** |
| Cover Crop Seeding | $5,000 | $3,750 | $4,500 | **$500** |

**Todd could get $9,000+ in infrastructure for $1,000 out of pocket.**

## WHAT TO BRING TO THE MEETING

### Required Documents
- [ ] Tax ID / EIN (81-5299411)
- [ ] Property deed or **lease agreement** (WARNING: No signed lease!)
- [ ] If no lease: Letter from Don Kretschmann authorizing land use
- [ ] Farm map showing fields/acres
- [ ] Photo ID

### Helpful to Have
- [ ] Farm Number (if you have one from FSA)
- [ ] List of current practices (organic certification, cover crops, etc.)
- [ ] Description of what you want to do (high tunnels, irrigation, etc.)

### The Lease Problem
**CRITICAL ISSUE:** EQIP requires proof you have control of the property.

**Options:**
1. Get Don to sign a simple lease (even year-to-year)
2. Get a signed letter from Don stating you have permission to farm the land
3. Ask NRCS what documentation they'll accept

**Talking point for Don:**
> "Don, I'm meeting with NRCS about conservation funding. They need documentation that I have permission to farm here. Would you be willing to sign a simple letter confirming our arrangement? This doesn't commit you to anything specific - it just verifies I'm authorized to be here."

## EQIP PRACTICES TO ASK ABOUT

### Season Extension (High Priority for Todd)
| Practice | Description | Why Todd Needs It |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **High Tunnel System** | Covered growing structure | Todd has tunnels ready to install; EQIP could fund installation/site prep |
| **Caterpillar Tunnels** | Low-cost hoop houses | Todd owns 4 caterpillar tunnels needing installation |

**Key Question:** Can EQIP fund installation of producer-owned structures, or only purchase of new ones?

### Irrigation & Water (Critical for 10-acre expansion)
| Practice | Description | Why Todd Needs It |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Irrigation System** | Drip/micro-irrigation | Expanding from 6 to 10 acres requires irrigation upgrade |
| **Water Management** | Wells, pumps, storage | May need additional water capacity |

### Soil Health (Aligns with Organic Status)
| Practice | Description | Why Todd Needs It |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Cover Crop** | Seeding cover crops | Already doing this; could get cost-share |
| **Nutrient Management** | Soil testing, planning | Supports organic certification |
| **Mulching** | Organic mulch materials | Weed control for organic production |

### Conservation (Good for Long-term)
| Practice | Description | Why Todd Needs It |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Pollinator Habitat** | Flower strips, habitat | Flower production provides this! |
| **Conservation Crop Rotation** | Planned rotation | Already practicing for organic |

## TALKING POINTS FOR TODD

### Introduce Yourself
> "I'm Todd Wilson, owner of Tiny Seed Farm. I've been farming organically on the Kretschmann property in Beaver County for about three years. We're a certified organic vegetable and flower farm serving the Pittsburgh area through CSA, farmers markets, and wholesale accounts."

### Explain Your Beginning Farmer Status
> "I understand Beginning Farmers qualify for enhanced cost-share rates. I've been farming for less than 10 years, so I should qualify. Can you confirm that?"

### Describe Your Needs
> "I'm expanding from 6 to 10 acres this year and need infrastructure support. Specifically, I have high tunnels and caterpillar tunnels I own but can't afford to install properly. I also need to upgrade my irrigation system for the expanded acreage."

### Ask About the Lease Situation
> "I need to be transparent - I don't currently have a signed lease with the landowner. We have a long-standing verbal arrangement, and he's planning to put the land into a farmland trust. What kind of documentation would NRCS accept to show I have control of the property?"

### Express Commitment
> "I'm committed to this land long-term. I practice organic methods, use cover crops, and want to invest in soil health. I see EQIP as a way to make those investments more affordable while meeting conservation goals."

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**EQIP could fund 90% of Todd's infrastructure needs.** As a Beginning Farmer, Todd is in the best possible position to receive EQIP funding. The main obstacle is the lack of a signed lease.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **This week:** Call NRCS to schedule consultation
2. **Before meeting:** Get written permission from Don (even informal letter)
3. **At meeting:** Be honest about lease situation, ask what they'll accept
4. **After meeting:** Prioritize resolving lease issue if required
