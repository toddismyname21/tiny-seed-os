## SECTION 2: PROJECT NARRATIVE

### Executive Summary

Tiny Seed Farm requests $62,500 to implement an Integrated Season Extension System that will enable year-round organic vegetable production in Western Pennsylvania. This project combines permanent high tunnel infrastructure with mobile caterpillar tunnels to create a flexible, climate-resilient growing system on certified organic land in Beaver County.

The project leverages $62,500 in applicant match, including producer-owned equipment (high tunnel and caterpillar tunnels valued at $27,500) and cash/labor contributions. Upon completion, the system will extend the growing season by 8-12 weeks, enable year-round baby greens production, and increase farm revenue by an estimated $75,000-100,000 annually.

### Problem Statement

Western Pennsylvania's short growing season (approximately 160 frost-free days) limits organic vegetable production to 6-7 months annually. This creates three significant challenges for small-scale organic farms like Tiny Seed Farm:

1. **Revenue Concentration:** 80% of annual revenue must be generated in a 5-month window (May-September), creating cash flow volatility and limiting growth potential.

2. **Market Gap:** Local demand for fresh, organic produce continues year-round, but regional farms cannot supply winter markets. Pittsburgh-area restaurants and consumers turn to California and Mexico imports from November through April.

3. **Climate Vulnerability:** Unpredictable spring and fall weather increasingly damages exposed crops. In 2025, late spring frosts and early fall cold snaps reduced Tiny Seed Farm's yields significantly during the transitional seasons.

Season extension infrastructure addresses all three challenges but requires significant capital investment that beginning farmers struggle to afford without grant support.

### Proposed Solution: Integrated Season Extension System

Tiny Seed Farm proposes to install an Integrated Season Extension System combining:

**1. High Tunnel (30' x 100' = 3,000 sq ft)**
- Producer-owned tunnel ready for professional installation
- Permanent structure for year-round production
- Primary use: Winter greens, early tomatoes, season-end crops

**2. Caterpillar Tunnel Array (4 units, 15' x 90' each = 5,400 sq ft)**
- Producer-owned tunnels ready for installation
- Mobile structures that can move between beds
- Primary use: Shoulder season production, hardening transplants, weather protection

**3. Integrated Irrigation System**
- Drip irrigation serving all tunnel structures
- Automated controls for efficient water use
- Connects to existing farm water supply

**4. Climate Monitoring & Controls**
- Ventilation systems for temperature management
- Soil temperature monitoring
- Frost protection heating for critical periods

**Total Protected Growing Space:** 8,400 square feet across 5 structures

### Innovation Elements

This project qualifies as agricultural innovation because it:

1. **Demonstrates Integrated System Design:** Rather than installing tunnels in isolation, this project creates a coordinated system where the high tunnel serves as the "anchor" for year-round production while caterpillar tunnels provide flexible, mobile protection. This approach maximizes the value of each structure type.

2. **Addresses Leased Land Challenges:** Many Pennsylvania beginning farmers operate on leased land without long-term tenure. This system demonstrates how to make strategic infrastructure investments on leased property - the high tunnel is positioned with landowner support, while mobile caterpillar tunnels can be relocated if necessary.

3. **Creates Replicable Model:** At 10 acres, Tiny Seed Farm represents the typical Pennsylvania small farm scale. Documentation and results from this project can guide other beginning farmers considering season extension investments.

4. **Supports Regional Food Security:** By extending local organic production into winter months, this project reduces regional dependence on imported produce and strengthens Pittsburgh's local food infrastructure.

### Alignment with Evaluation Criteria

**RELEVANT:** This innovation directly addresses the challenge of seasonal production limitations that constrain Pennsylvania's small farm sector. Climate volatility makes protected growing increasingly essential for farm viability.

**PRACTICAL:** The project uses proven technology (high tunnels, caterpillar tunnels, drip irrigation) in an innovative integrated configuration. Installation follows established best practices with minimal operational complexity.

**ACCESSIBLE:** The system operates at the individual farm level and produces immediately marketable crops. Results benefit local consumers, restaurants, and the regional food system.

**SCALABLE:** The 10-acre operation size and investment level are replicable by small and medium-sized Pennsylvania farms. The project model can be adopted by other beginning farmers seeking to extend their growing seasons.

### Alignment with Farm Goals

This project directly supports Tiny Seed Farm's 2026 strategic priorities:

1. **Storage Crops Focus:** Protected structures enable production of high-value storage crops (carrots, beets, leeks) that can be harvested into December and stored for winter sales.

2. **Baby Greens Market Dominance:** Year-round baby greens production positions Tiny Seed Farm to capture Pittsburgh's restaurant market demand currently served by distant suppliers.

3. **10-Acre Expansion:** Season extension infrastructure supports the transition from 6 to 10 acres by extending revenue generation across more calendar months.
