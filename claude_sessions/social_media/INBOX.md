## OVERNIGHT MISSION (Owner is sleeping - WORK AUTONOMOUSLY)

### PRIMARY ASSIGNMENT: USPS DIRECT MAIL MARKETING SYSTEM

Owner wants to develop a direct mail marketing strategy with an algorithm to find high-value addresses.

#### Task 1: Direct Mail Research

**Research USPS direct mail options:**
- Every Door Direct Mail (EDDM)
- Targeted mailing lists
- Postcard vs letter costs
- Bulk mail discounts
- Design requirements

Create `/claude_sessions/social_media/DIRECT_MAIL_RESEARCH.md`:
- USPS program options
- Cost per piece at different volumes
- Timeline from design to delivery
- Best practices for response rates

#### Task 2: High-Value Address Algorithm

**Owner's vision:** "Algorithm to generate high value addresses for direct mail marketing"

**Target demographics:**
- New developments (new construction neighborhoods)
- New home buyers
- Affluent zip codes
- Areas near farmers markets
- Food-conscious neighborhoods

Create `/claude_sessions/social_media/ADDRESS_TARGETING_ALGORITHM.md`:

**Research data sources:**
- Zillow/Realtor APIs for new sales
- USPS new mover lists
- Census data for demographics
- Property tax records
- Neighborhood income data

**Define scoring algorithm:**
```
High-Value Address Score =
  (Income_Factor × 0.3) +
  (Distance_to_Farm × 0.2) +
  (New_Homeowner × 0.25) +
  (Food_Interest_Indicators × 0.25)
```

Document how to identify and prioritize addresses.

#### Task 3: "Won't You Be My Neighbor" Landing Page

**Owner wants a dedicated landing page for direct mail recipients.**

Create `/claude_sessions/social_media/NEIGHBOR_LANDING_PAGE_SPEC.md`:

**Page concept:**
- Warm, welcoming design
- "You're invited to join our farm community"
- Introduction to Tiny Seed Farm
- CSA signup / newsletter signup
- Farm location and contact
- Special offer for direct mail recipients (trackable)

**Include:**
- Wireframe/mockup
- Copy suggestions
- Call-to-action design
- How to track direct mail conversions

#### Task 4: Campaign Planner

Create `/claude_sessions/social_media/DIRECT_MAIL_CAMPAIGN_PLAN.md`:

**First campaign plan:**
- Target: 500-1000 households
- Timing: When to send (pre-season?)
- Message: What to say
- Offer: What incentive
- Budget: Estimated costs
- Expected response rate
- ROI calculation

#### Deliverable: MORNING DIRECT MAIL BRIEF

Create `/claude_sessions/social_media/MORNING_DIRECT_MAIL_BRIEF.md`:
