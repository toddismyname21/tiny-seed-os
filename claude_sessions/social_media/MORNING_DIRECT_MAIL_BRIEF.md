## TL;DR - What I Built Overnight

I researched and designed a complete direct mail marketing system for Tiny Seed Farm:

| Deliverable | Status | File |
|-------------|--------|------|
| USPS Research | Done | `DIRECT_MAIL_RESEARCH.md` |
| Targeting Algorithm | Done | `ADDRESS_TARGETING_ALGORITHM.md` |
| Landing Page Spec | Done | `NEIGHBOR_LANDING_PAGE_SPEC.md` |
| Campaign Plan | Done | `DIRECT_MAIL_CAMPAIGN_PLAN.md` |

## The Recommendation

### Start with EDDM (Every Door Direct Mail)

**Why:**
- Cheapest option ($0.25/piece postage)
- No mailing list needed
- Target by neighborhood
- Simple execution

**First Campaign:**
- 1,000 postcards to Squirrel Hill area
- Total cost: ~$500
- Expected result: 20 new CSA members ($10,000 revenue)
- **ROI: 20x**

---

## The Targeting Algorithm

I designed a scoring system to identify high-value addresses:

```
HIGH-VALUE SCORE =
  Income Factor (25%) +
  Proximity to Farm (20%) +
  New Mover Status (25%) +
  Housing Type (15%) +
  Food Interest (15%)
```

**Top targets:**
- New homeowners in Squirrel Hill, Fox Chapel, Shadyside
- Households with $80K+ income
- Within 10 miles of farm
- Single-family homes, owned

---

## The Landing Page Concept

**URL:** `tinyseedfarm.com/neighbor`

**Theme:** "Won't You Be My Neighbor"
- Warm, welcoming invitation
- Beautiful farm photos
- Clear offer: 25% off + free farm tour
- Simple email signup
- Trackable with promo code `NEIGHBOR25`

I included a full wireframe and copy suggestions in the spec.
