## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Based on analysis of wholesale accounts, CSA pickup locations, and home delivery data, Tiny Seed Farm operates a multi-day delivery system with three primary route types:

1. **Wednesday Routes** - Main delivery day serving CSA pickups + home deliveries
2. **Tuesday** - Lawrenceville Farmers Market only
3. **Saturday** - Bloomfield & Sewickley Farmers Markets

The 10-minute acceptance rule will be applied to **Wednesday home deliveries** since that's when the farm already has established routes in the field.

## 8. QUESTIONS FOR OWNER

1. **Route separation:** Do you run Northern, Southern, and Main routes on the same day or different drivers/times?

2. **Restaurant delivery days:** Are wholesale deliveries every Wednesday or specific days?

3. **Time windows:** Do restaurants have required delivery windows?

4. **Driver capacity:** What's the maximum number of stops per route?

## 10. NEXT STEPS

1. **Validate base route times** using Google Routes API
2. **Build acceptance algorithm** with 10-minute threshold
3. **Create visualization** of acceptance zones
4. **Integrate with Shopify** checkout for real-time validation
5. **Build driver route optimizer** for daily route generation
